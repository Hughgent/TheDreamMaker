<p>
Just as there are a number of pre-defined variables defining the properties
of objects, there are also pre-defined procs that control how the objects
behave in certain situations.  A programmer would call many of these
<em>event handlers</em>, because they define how the object responds to
various events.
</p><p>
Some of the pre-defined procedures don't do anything at all but exist solely
for the purpose of allowing you to override them with your own definition.
Such empty procedures are often called <em>hooks</em> because they provide a
place for you to attach your own handler for an event.  However, in DM, not
just the hooks, but all other object procedures as well are available to be
redefined and customized to suit your own needs.

<a name="7.1">
</a><a name="MovementProcs">

<p>
Both mobs and objs are capable of movement (though mobs are usually the only
ones to do it of their own volition).  You have already seen how the density
variable restricts movement: no two dense objects may occupy the same
position.  This rule, among others, is enforced by the various movement
procs.
</p><p>
Note that movement is not restricted to positions on the map.  Objects can
move inside of each other as well.  For example, when a mob picks up a
sword, the sword moves from the map into the mob.  The sword could then be
moved into a bag object for safe keeping.  Any change of location, whether
it be on the map or inside other objects, is considered a movement.

<h4><a name="7.1.1">1.1 <var>Enter</var></a></h4>
<a name="7.1.1">

<p>
The <var>Enter</var> proc is defined for all four object types.  It returns 1
if the specified object may enter the source and 0 if not.  If the object
entering is dense and there is already a dense object at the location,
entrance will be refused.
</p><p>

Suppose you introduced a magic spell that made people intangible (i.e.
non-dense) and able to walk through walls.  You might still want some walls
to be impenetrable.  This could be easily accomplished by overriding the
<var>Enter</var> proc.
</p><p>

</p><pre>turf/lead_wall
   name = "lead wall"
   Enter(O)
      return 0 //none may enter here

<h4><a name="7.1.2">1.2 <var>Exit</var></a></h4>
<a name="7.1.2">

<p>
The <var>Exit</var> proc is the counterpart to <var>Enter</var>.  It returns 1
if the specified object may exit the source and 0 if not.  By default, exits
are always allowed.

By redefining this proc, one could make a nasty trap.

<h4><a name="7.1.3">1.3 <var>Bump</var></a></h4>
<a name="7.1.3">

<p>
The <var>Bump</var> proc is called when movement fails because of a dense
blockage.  If the mob trying to move happens to be in the group list of the
mob who was in the way, the two will swap positions.
</p><p>
</p><table align="center" border="1"><tbody><tr><td>
<table border="0">

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p></p><p>
This proc could be overridden to also include the rule that all players,
regardless of group membership, will swap positions.
</p><p>

</p><pre>mob/Bump(mob/M)
   if(istype(M) &amp;&amp; M.key &amp;&amp; src.key)
      var/pos = M.loc
      M.loc = usr.loc
      usr.loc = pos
   else ..()
</pre>
<p>

</p><p>
The <var>istype()</var> instruction is used to determine if the value
contained by a variable is indeed of the same type as the variable.  Here we
use it to see if the blockage is really a mob.  It could also have been
spelled out like this: <code>istype(M,/mob)</code>.
</p><p>
If the blockage is a mob and if both mobs in question have keys, their
positions are swapped.  Instead of directly assigning the mobs to their new
positions, you might want to make one of them non-dense and do a proper
movement.  How and why you would do that is described next.

<h4><a name="7.1.4">1.4 <var>Move</var></a></h4>
<a name="7.1.4">

<p>
The <var>Move</var> proc is the one which ties all the other movement procs
together.  It calls the <var>Enter</var> proc of the destination.  If this
fails, it calls <var>Bump</var>.  Otherwise, the <var>Exit</var> proc of the
original location is called next and finally, if that succeeds, the source
is assigned to the new location.  The return value is 1 on success and 0 on
failure.
</p><p>
</p><table align="center" border="1"><tbody><tr><td>

<p></p><p>

</p><p>
The direction parameter need not be specified.  It is relevant to one more
thing that the <var>Move</var> proc handles, which is changing the direction
the object that moved is facing.  If the direction argument is specified, it
will be used as the new direction to face; otherwise it will be computed
from the relative positions of the original and final locations.
</p><p>
The other movement procs are not usually called directly.  The <var>Move</var>
proc, on the other hand, can be useful if you want an object to move in
accordance with all the movement rules.  Directly assigning the object to a
location bypasses all such density checking, bumping, and direction changing.
</p><p>
You could, for example, make a magic scroll that would teleport the spell
caster to any open position in view.
</p><p>

</p><pre>obj/scroll/teleport
   verb/teleport(T as turf)
      set src = usr.contents
      if(!usr.Move(T)) usr &lt;&lt; "You cannot move there!"
      else view() &lt;&lt; "[usr] dances through the ethers!"
</pre>
</a><p><a name="7.1.4">
There is much more to say on the subject of movement.  For example, one
might want to make NPC mobs walk around without mindlessly bumping into
obstacles.  Many useful movement instructions and techniques will be discussed
in section </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap14.html#MovementInstructions">14.2</a>.

<h3><a name="7.2">2. Object Creation and Destruction</a></h3>
<a name="7.2">
</a><a name="NewDel">

<p>
You have already seen examples using the instructions <var>new</var> and
<var>del</var>.  These are used to create or destroy objects.  Another way of
creating objects is to place them on the initial map using the map editor.
When the world is finally shut down, any objects that remain are destroyed
at that time.  Since you might want to do some special action when an object
is created or destroyed, DM provides procs to handle these events.
</p></a><p><a name="NewDel">
</a><a name="7.2.1">
</a></p>
<h4><a name="7.2.1">2.1 <var>New</var> proc</a></h4>
<a name="7.2.1">

<p>
The <var>New</var> proc is called when an object has been created.  It may be
used to do any special initializations required by the object.  By default,
it doesn't do anything.
</p><p>
</p><table align="center" border="1"><tbody><tr><td>
<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><td>
<var>New</var> </td>
<td> (Loc) </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
             </td>
<td> <code>Loc</code> is the initial position of the object.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p></p><p>
When an object is created with <var>new</var>, the location and any additional
arguments you define are passed in at that time.  The syntax for doing so is:
</p><p>
</p><table align="center" border="1"><tbody><tr><td>
<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><td>
<var>new</var> </td>
<td> Type(Loc,...) </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
             </td>
<td> <code>Type</code> is the type of object to create. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
             </td>
<td> <code>Loc</code> is the initial position of the object. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
             </td>
<td> ... contains any additional arguments.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p></p><p>
Note that the object is created at the initial position.  It doesn't move
there--it just gets directly assigned to the location.  If no initial
position is specified, the object's location is <var>null</var>, which means
it won't show up on the map.
</p><p>
As an example, one could make an object that plays a sound when created.
</p><p>

</p><pre>obj/portal
   New()
      view() &lt;&lt; "A shimmering portal appears!"
      view() &lt;&lt; 'portal.wav'
mob/DM
   verb
      make_portal(NewName as text)
         var/obj/portal/P = new/obj/portal(usr.loc)
         if(NewName) P.name = NewName
</pre>
<p>
The use of <var>new</var> here is very common.  We declared a variable,
assigned it to a new object, and made additional modifications through the
variable.  In this case a useful abbreviation can be applied.  The variable
being assigned has the same type as the new object being created.  Instead
of specifying the redundant type information, it can simply be left out.  In
that case, the call would be <code>new(usr.loc)</code> instead.  Also note that
in the example above, space is optional between <var>new</var> and
<code>/obj/portal</code>.
</p><p>
The same example can be redesigned to pass the new name in as a parameter.
</p><p>

</p><pre>obj/portal
   New(Loc,Name)
      if(Name) name = Name
      view() &lt;&lt; "A shimmering portal appears!"
      view() &lt;&lt; 'portal.wav'
mob/DM
   make_portal(Name as text)
      new/obj/portal(usr.loc,Name)
</pre>
<p>
The choice of whether to pass such information as a parameter to
<var>New</var> or whether to perform the assignments elsewhere depends on how
often you will be doing that same configuration task.  One time when you
would want to use parameters to <var>New</var> is if you wish to handle the
information differently in derived objects.  Then you could simply override
the <var>New</var> proc in those cases.
</p></a><p><a name="7.2.1">
</a><a name="7.2.2">
</a></p>
<h4><a name="7.2.2">2.2 <var>Del</var> proc</a></h4>
<a name="7.2.2">

<p>
The <var>Del</var> proc is called to destroy an object.  By default, this
causes the contents of an obj or mob to be dumped to its location.  A player
using the mob will be disconnected from the world.  Any additional cleanup
can be handled in your own redefinition of the <var>Del</var> proc.
</p><p>
</p><table align="center" border="1"><tbody><tr><td>
<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><td>
<var>Del</var>()
</td>

</tbody>

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p></p><p>
This proc can be called directly or it can be called by using the
<var>del</var> command.  The advantage of the <var>del</var> instruction is you
don't need to have the type of the object declared as you do to call the
<var>Del</var> sub-procedure.
</p><p>
</p><table align="center" border="1"><tbody><tr><td>
<table border="0">

<p></p><p>

</p></a><p><a name="7.2.2">
When an object is deleted, any existing references to it are set to
<var>null</var>.  Therefore, if you have a variable referring to an object that
could have been deleted, you should check to make sure it isn't
<var>null</var> before trying to access any of the object's variables or
procedures.  If you don't, your proc will crash.  Debugging techniques
related to this issue will be discussed in section </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap19.html#Debugging">19.3.2</a>.
</p>
<p>
A very simply example of <var>Del</var> would make an object play a little
death tune.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<pre>mob/Del()
   view() &lt;&lt; 'death.wav'
   ..()
</pre>
<p>
It is important to remember to call the parent proc, since it performs the
actual deletion.
</p>
<p>
In practice, it is usually best to define a second proc (say <code>Die</code>) that
handles a real death and reserve <var>Del</var>() for the abstract business of
deleting the object.  That way (for example) you can remove player mobs when
they are not in use by saving them to a file and then deleting them.  You
probably wouldn't want them to appear to die each time they log off!
</p>
<p>

</p>
<pre>obj/corpse
   icon = 'corpse.dmi'
mob
   var/corpse = /obj/corpse
   proc/Die()
      if(corpse) new corpse(loc)
      src &lt;&lt; "See you around!"
      del src
</pre>
<p>
With this definition, we would call <code>mob.Die()</code> when we want a mob to die.
By default, that just creates a corpse and deletes the mob.  That behavior
could easily be overridden for different types of mobs.  For example, you
might want players to remain connected but be penalized in some way.
</p>
<p>
<a name="7.2.3">
</a></p>
<h4><a name="7.2.3">2.3 Areas and Rooms</a></h4>
<a name="7.2.3">

<p>
The creation and deletion of areas are handled somewhat specially.  When the
same area is placed in several positions, the actual area object is only
created once.  <var>New()</var> is only called the first time the area is
created.  From then on, new positions are simply marked as part of the
existing area.
</p><p>
It is also possible to create areas that are not on the map.  These are
called <em>rooms</em> and may be used as locations for any number of other
objects.  (Note that density is ignored in rooms; it only applies to objects
on the map.)
</p><p>
Rooms can be created with <var>new</var> by not specifying a location (or by
passing <var>null</var>).  Another even easier way is to define the area but
never place it on the map.  When you access the area at run-time, the room
will be automatically created.
</p><p>
You could, for example, create a special room for players to enter when they
die where they can do penance and meditate on the sins of their previous
life.
</p><p>

</p><pre>area/Purgatory
   Enter()
      usr &lt;&lt; "Welcome to [src]."
      return ..()

mob/proc
   Die()
      if(key) //players
         loc = locate(/area/Purgatory)
      else    //NPCs
         del src
</pre>
<p>
You would probably also want to provide a way out, since the patience of
players who have just suffered a gruesome death is often rather thin.  A
verb that teleports them back to the land of the living would do the trick.
In both cases, the <var>locate</var> instruction is useful for getting a
reference to the destination.

<h3><a name="7.3">3. <var>Stat</var> proc</a></h3>
<a name="7.3">
</a><a name="StatProc">

<p>
The <var>Stat</var> proc is used to display information about an object in
some panels on the player's screen.  These are called the <em>stats</em>.  By
default, the player only sees the stats of her own mob, but the designer
could provide facilities for the player to see the stats of other objects.

</td>

</tbody>

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p></p><p>
Each stat panel consists of a number of lines.  The lines each have an
optional name and a corresponding value which is displayed next to it.  To
generate a line of output in the stat panel, one uses the <var>stat</var>
instruction.
</p><p>
</p><table align="center" border="1"><tbody><tr><td>
<table border="0">

The following example generates a typical panel of player stats.
</p><p>

   stat("description",desc)
   stat("")  //blank line
   stat("strength",strength)
   stat("health",health)
   stat("odor",odor)
</pre>
<p>
To provide structure to the stats, a second instruction, <var>statpanel</var>,
provides the ability to create multiple panels.  It takes the name of a
panel and an optional stat line to display.  If no stat line is specified,
the given panel becomes the default panel for subsequent output.  If no call
to <var>statpanel</var> is made, the default panel simply has the name "" (an
empty text string).

</tbody>

<p></p><p>
One final nuance is that you can pass an entire list of objects as the value
for a stat, in which case the objects are displayed in a list to the
player.  This is equivalent to looping through the list and generating an
individual (unnamed) stat line for each item.  This feature is most often
used with <var>statpanel</var> to create a separate panel for the list.
</p><p>
The following example displays the player's description as well as an
inventory and group list.
</p><p>

</p><pre>mob/Stat()
   stat(desc)
   statpanel("Inventory",usr.contents)
   statpanel("Group",usr.group)
</pre>
</a><p><a name="StatProc">
One additional nicety would be to avoid generating the inventory and group
panels if their contents are blank.  You could accomplish that by checking
<var>usr.contents.len</var>, a variable indicating the length of the list.
This and other list details will be discussed in chapter </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap10.html#ListChapter">10</a>.
</p>
<p>
The following example shows the framework for generating a typical
multi-panel stat display.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<pre>mob/Stat()
   if(statpanel("Stats"))
      stat("health",health)
      stat("strength",strength)
   if(statpanel("Description"))
      stat("appearance",desc)
      stat("race",race)
   statpanel("Inventory",contents)
</pre>
<p>
Notice the use of <var>statpanel()</var> in a conditional statement, making
use of the fact that this procedure returns true only when the specified
panel is visible to the player.  This is not strictly necessary but it is
more efficient, because it doesn't bother to fill panels that aren't visible
to the player.  Since the <var>Stat</var> proc may be called quite frequently
to update the stats display, it is good to avoid extra overhead when
possible.

<p></p><p>
One common use of the <var>Login</var>() proc is to welcome players and place
them at a starting location.  By default, <var>Login</var>() places the player
at the first available opening on the map.
</p><p>

</p><pre>turf/landing_pad
   name = "landing pad"
mob/Login()
   if(loc)  //reconnecting
      usr &lt;&lt; "Welcome back, [name]."
   else
      usr &lt;&lt; "Welcome, [name]!"
      loc = locate(/turf/landing_pad)
</pre>
<p>
If there is a possibility of players reconnecting to existing mobs, it is
best to check if the player is already at some location before making the
initial placement as we have done here.  If, on the other hand, you don't
want player mobs to be retained when players disconnect, you could remove
them in the <var>Logout</var> proc.
</p><p>

</p><pre>mob/Logout()
   del src
</pre>
</a><p><a name="Login">
Alternately, you could just make the mob disappear by setting the location
to <var>null</var>.  That is a quick and easy way to "save" players when
they log out.  It won't, however, survive a shutdown of the world, which
could happen if you need to reboot it after making code changes or (if there
is a serious bug) the server crashes.  To handle cases like that, you need
to use a save file, which will be discussed in chapter </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap12.html#SavefileChapter">12</a>.

<p>
An object's <var>Topic</var> proc is executed when the player clicks on a
hyperlink that references that object.  A hyperlink is a clickable region in
the output text (usually underlined) that causes some action to take place
when it is selected.  In this case, the hyperlink is called a <em>topic</em>
link because it contains information (called the topic) which the object may
use to form a response.
</p><p>
First, you need to know how to embed a link to an object in some output
text.  Since hyperlinks were popularized by the web, DM uses the same syntax
as an HTML web document.  It is a little strange, but my mother always says
an ounce of strangeness is better than a pound of competing syntaxes.  So
following that wisdom, we use the HTML <em>anchor</em> tag &lt;A&gt; to form a
hyperlink.

<table border="0">

"... </td>

&gt; <u>click here</u> &lt;/A&gt; ..."</td>

<tr><td>
        </td>
<td> <code>Obj</code> is the linked object. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
        </td>
<td> <code>Topic</code> is the link topic.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p></p><p>
The code <code>\ref</code><code>[Obj]</code> is used to specify the object associated
with the hyperlink.  This is followed by whatever text you need in order to
identify this particular link from others to the same object.
</p><p>
The player, of course, doesn't see the scary looking stuff inside the
&lt; &gt;'s.  All he has to do is click on the link to call the object's
<var>Topic</var> proc with the hidden topic data.
</p><p>
</p><table align="center" border="1"><tbody><tr><td>
<table border="0">

<var>Topic</var> </td>

<tr><td>
               </td>
<td> <code>Topic</code> is the link topic.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<p></p><p>
The following example uses topic links to form the skeleton for a
conversational NPC.
</p><p>

</p></a><pre><a name="ObjectTopic">mob/Noah/Topic(Topic)
   if(Topic == "weather")
      usr &lt;&lt; "Looks a little </a><a href="#\ref[src]storm">stormy</a>."
   if(Topic == "storm")
      usr &lt;&lt; "I'd say about 40 days worth!"

mob/Noah/verb/hello()
   set src in view()
   usr &lt;&lt; "Nice <a href="#\ref[src]weather">weather</a>, eh?"
</pre>
<p>
Object topics are just one type of hyperlink.  More will be said on the
subject in section <a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap09.html#ClientTopic">9.2.4</a> and chapter <a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap11.html#InputOutputChapter">11</a>.
