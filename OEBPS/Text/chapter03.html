<p>
</p><blockquote>  As mind is the witness and reality of all dream-objects, so soul
  is the only reality in the diversities of this universe.
</blockquote>
<center>--Bhagavat Gita</center>

<p>
There are four basic object types.  Each has its own special properties, as
well as those that they all share.  The basic objects are
<em>mob</em>, <em>obj</em>, <em>turf</em>, and <em>area</em>.  There are other
objects as well, but these four are the ones which are visible to players.
We call them <em>atomic</em> objects.
</p><p>
The simplest difference between them is the order in which they appear on
the map.  Areas are drawn in the first layer.  The icon of an area is often
simply a solid background color.  Turfs are drawn on top of areas; these
usually represent some type of terrain like grass, roads, or walls.  Objs
are drawn next, and might stand for items such as swords or cookies.  Mobs
are drawn on top of everything else.  They normally represent players or
computer-controlled creatures.  <small>(The term <em>mob</em> stands for
<em>mobile object</em>.  It is also suggestive of <em>monster</em>, which is a
common role they play.)</small>  
</p><p>
On the map, the mobs and objs are said to be <em>contained</em> by the turf.
That in turn is contained by the area.  It is also possible for mobs and
objs to contain things.  For example, a chest obj might contain a bunch of
treasure items; and a player's mob could contain all the player's
possessions.
</p><p>
Notice how I keep using words like `might,' `could,' or `normally.' That is
because DM gives you, the designer, a great deal of flexibility.  Many of
the basic object properties were defined with a particular purpose in mind.
That doesn't mean you have to use them that way.  The meaning of the game
objects is up to you.

<h3><a name="3.1">1. Object Properties</a></h3>
<a name="3.1">

</a><p><a name="3.1">
First let us look at the properties that all of the objects have in common.
We have already seen that they each have a name and an icon.  These are
variables.  (There are also some procs, but the discussion of those takes
place later in chapter </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap07.html#ObjectProcChapter">7</a>.)  Here is a list of each
variable and a description of its purpose.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<li><b>name</b>
<p>
This is the name of the object, which by default is the same as the type
(i.e. node) name with any underscores replaced by spaces.
</p><p>

</p></li>
<li><b>gender</b>
<p>
The grammatical gender of the object may be set using this variable.  The
possible values are <code>"neuter"</code>, <code>"male"</code>, <code>"female"</code>, and
<code>"plural"</code>.  The default is <code>"neuter"</code>.
</p><p>

</p></li>
<li><b>desc</b>
<p>
This is a description of the object.  It often appears in the "stat"
panels when the player examines the object.  Controlling the content of
those panels will be discussed in section <a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap07.html#StatProc">7.3</a>.
</p><p>

</p></li>
<li><b>suffix</b>
<p>
This is some text commonly displayed after the name of the object in the
"stat" panels.  For example, this could indicate the status of equipment
items: <code>"(weapon in hand)"</code>, <code>"(worn on body)"</code>, and so on.
</p><p>

</p></li>
<li><b>text</b>
<p>
This is a single character used to represent the object on a non-graphical
map.  If you have ever played rogue or any of its derivatives, you will know
what this means.
</p><p>

</p></li>
<li><b>icon</b>
<p>
This is the icon file used to graphically represent the object.
</p><p>

</p></li>
<li><b>icon_state</b>
<p>
Icon files may contain several alternate representations for an object.
For example, a door could be open or closed.  This variable is the name of
the currently active state.
</p><p>

</p></li>
<li><b>dir</b>
<p>
This is the direction the object is facing.  Some icons may be directional,
meaning that they look different depending on which way the object is
pointed.  This is most often used for mobs, which change direction as they
move around.
</p><p>

</p></li>
<li><b>overlays</b>
<p>
This is a list of icons or object types which appear on top of the object's
main icon.
</p><p>

</p></li>
<li><b>underlays</b>
<p>
This is a list of icons or object types which appear underneath the object's
main icon.
</p><p>

</p></li>
<li><b>visibility</b>
<p>
This is 1 or 0 to indicate whether the object is visible.
</p><p>

</p></li>
<li><b>luminosity</b>
<p>
This is 0 to 6 to indicate how far the object emits light.  Only areas are
luminous by default, which has the effect of casting light on everything
else in the area.
</p><p>

</p></li>
<li><b>opacity</b>
<p>
This is 1 or 0 depending on whether the object blocks light.  An opaque
object will block the view of objects behind it.
</p><p>

</p></li>
<li><b>density</b>
<p>
This is 1 or 0 to indicate whether the object fills up the space it
occupies.  Only mobs are dense by default.  Normally, no two dense objects
may occupy the same position (but you will see how to circumvent that in
section <a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap07.html#MovementProcs">7.1</a>).
</p><p>

</p></li>
<li><b>contents</b>
<p>
This is a list of all the objects directly inside of an object.  The term
often used in the case of mobs is <em>inventory</em>.  You will learn more
about this and lists in general in chapter&#160;<a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap10.html#ListChapter">10</a>.
</p><p>

</p></li>
<li><b>verbs</b>
<p>
This is a list of the verbs (that is, commands) associated with the object.
These will be discussed in chapter&#160;<a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap04.html#VerbChapter">4</a>.
</p><p>

</p></li>
<li><b>type</b>
<p>
This is the type path of the object.  For example, it might be
<tt>/turf</tt> or <tt>/turf/trap</tt>.  You could look at this value in a
procedure in order to find out what type of object you are dealing with.
</p><p>

</p><p>
<a name="3.1.1">
</a></p><h4><a name="3.1.1">1.1 Location</a></h4><a name="3.1.1">
</a><p><a name="3.1.1">
The following location variables apply to all object types except areas,
which never exist inside other objects.  These variables are only used in
proc code, which will be discussed in chapter&#160;</a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap06.html#ProcChapter">6</a>.
</p><p>

<a name="LocVars">
</a></p><p><a name="LocVars">

</a></p></li>
<li><a name="LocVars"><b>loc</b>
<p>
This indicates the container of an object.  In other words, if object A
contains object B, B's loc will be equal to A, and B will exist in A's
contents list.
</p><p>

</p></a></li>
<li><a name="LocVars"><b>x, y, z</b>
<p>
These indicate the position of an object on the map.  Valid coordinates
start at (1,1,1).  The x and y coordinates represent east/west and
north/south positioning, respectively.  The z coordinate specifies the map
level.
</p><p>

</p></a><p><a name="LocVars">
</a><a name="3.1.2">
</a></p><h4><a name="3.1.2">1.2 Additional Mob Properties</a></h4><a name="3.1.2">
</a><a name="MobVars">
<p>
In addition to these commonly held variables, mobs add a few of their own.
</p><p>

</p><p>

</p></a></li>
<li><a name="MobVars"><b>key</b>
<p>
This is the login name of the player.  By default, when a new mob is created
for a player, the mob's name is set equal to this.  Every key is
unique--even when stripped of punctuation and ignoring case.  That makes it
a good way to keep track of people.
</p><p>

</p></a></li>
<li><a name="MobVars"><b>ckey</b>
</a><p><a name="MobVars">
This is the player's key in canonical form (stripped of punctuation and
converted to lowercase).  This is useful when saving information about the
player for future use.  More will be said about doing that in
chapter&#160;</a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap12.html#SavefileChapter">12</a>.
</p><p>

</p></li>
<li><b>client</b>
<p>
This is the player's client object (if any).  The client object will be
described in chapter&#160;<a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap09.html#ClientChapter">9</a>.
</p><p>

</p></li>
<li><b>sight</b>
<p>
This value controls special visual powers of a mob, permitting sight of
invisible or obscured objects.  It can be one or more of the following
numerical constants added together: SEEINVIS, SEEMOBS,
SEEOBJS, SEETURFS, BLIND.
</p><p>
  <small>(
  Normally, one uses the bitwise OR operator <b>|</b> to combine sight
  values.  However, you can use a plain old <b>+</b> as long as you don't
  include the same value more than once.
)</small>  
</p><p>

</p></li>
<li><b>group</b>
<p>
This is a list of one's mob friends.  It serves the very practical purpose
of avoiding traffic problems.  When a friend tries to move past another, the
two switch places.  Otherwise it can be rather annoying to continually bump
into each other.  This variable would be manipulated in the proc code.
</p><p>

</p><p>
<a name="3.2">
</a></p><h3><a name="3.2">2. Assigning Variables</a></h3><a name="3.2">
<p>

</p><p>
By assigning a few variables, one can create a wide variety of objects.
This is done in the object definition.  For example, here are a few
different combinations of opacity and density.
</p><p>

</p><pre>turf
   floor
      icon = 'floor.dmi'

   wall
      icon = 'wall.dmi'
      density = 1
      opacity = 1

      secret_door
         name = "wall"
         density = 0

   window
      icon = 'window.dmi'
      density = 1
</pre>
<p>
This example defines four turfs: <code>floor</code>, <code>wall</code>, <code>secret_door</code>,
and <code>window</code>.  One can walk and see across the floor but not the wall.
The secret door is just like a wall, except one can walk through it.  To
round out the set, the window is transparent but not traversable.
</p><p>
Notice how we had to explicitly set the name of the secret door to
<code>wall</code> to prevent the default <code>secret door</code> from taking effect.  You
would also need to do this if you wanted the name to contain a character
that is not allowed in a node name.
</p></a><p><a name="3.2">
</a><a name="3.2.1">
</a></p><h4><a name="3.2.1">2.1 Constant Values</a></h4><a name="3.2.1">
<p>
This example illustrates three basic types of values: numbers, text strings,
and resource files.  These are called constant values.
</p></a><p><a name="3.2.1">
</a><a name="3.2.1.1">
</a></p><h5><a name="3.2.1.1">2.1.1 Numbers</a></h5><a name="3.2.1.1">
<p>

</p><p>
Numerical constants may be positive or negative, integer or floating point,
and can make use of scientific notation.  For example 3.15e7 or 31500000 is
approximately the number of seconds in a year.  The maximum possible value
is 3.4e38 and the smallest is 1.4e-45.  <small>(The numerical limits are
those of a single-precision IEEE floating point value, in case you were
wondering.)</small>  
</p></a><p><a name="3.2.1.1">
</a><a name="3.2.1.2">
</a></p><h5><a name="3.2.1.2">2.1.2 Text</a></h5><a name="3.2.1.2">
</a><a name="TextConstants">

<p>
Text constants are often simply called <em>strings</em> by programmers because
they consist of a string of characters.  They begin and end with a double
quote.  There are several special <em>text macros</em> that can be used inside
the text.  For example, a name is assumed to be a proper noun if it is
capitalized.  You can override that by using the <code>\improper</code> text macro.
</p><p>

</p><pre>obj/CPU
   name = "\improper CPU"
</pre>
</a><p><a name="TextConstants">
Like all text macros, <code>\improper</code> begins with a backslash.  The space
after it serves merely as a separator and is ignored.  A complete
description of this and other text macros will be given in section
</a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap11.html#TextMacros">11.3</a>.
</p><p>
In this particular example, the purpose of using <code>\improper</code> is to
modify how the name of the object is treated in output text.  As an improper
noun, it would produce sentences like "You insert the CPU." rather than
"You insert CPU." You will see exactly how to construct sentences like
that later.
</p><p>
<a name="3.2.1.3">
</a></p><h5><a name="3.2.1.3">2.1.3 Resource Files</a></h5><a name="3.2.1.3">

<p>
Resource files, such as icons or sounds are specified inside single quotes.
For instance, to access an icon file located at
<tt>C:\myworld\man.dmi</tt>, you would enter the value
<code>'man.dmi'</code>.  You can make use of sub-directories within your project to
organize things as you wish.
</p></a><p><a name="3.2.1.3">
</a><a name="3.2.2">
</a></p><h4><a name="3.2.2">2.2 Constant Macros</a></h4><a name="3.2.2">

<p>
If you use a particular value in several places, you might want to define a
macro for it, rather than repeatedly entering the same value.  This is also
useful if you want to be able to easily change the value in the future.
Rather than hunt for it in your code, you can simply change the definition.
To easily identify them in the code, it is standard practice to capitalize
macros.  Example:
</p><p>

</p><pre>#define MASTER_KEY "Dan"  //The all-powerful super-user!

mob/DM
   key = MASTER_KEY
</pre>
<p>
This example defines a special mob type for use by the DM (Dungeon Master,
Dream Maker, Dan Maestro, or whatever self-serving title you desire).  No
code has been included to this effect, but one could give the DM all sorts
of awesome powers to manage the game.  By defining the <code>MASTER_KEY</code>
macro at the beginning of the code, it is easy to notice and change at a
later date (say if someone else takes over).
</p><p>
When players log in, before creating a mob for them, a search is first made
to find an existing mob or type of mob with the corresponding key.  If one is
found, that mob becomes the player's avatar.  Otherwise, a new mob is
created for the purpose and assigned the player's key.  Therefore, a player
who logs out and comes back later would normally re-inhabit the same mob.
</p></a><p><a name="3.2.2">
</a><a name="3.3">
</a></p><h3><a name="3.3">3. Putting It All Together</a></h3><a name="3.3">
<p>
As a demonstration of all four basic object types, consider the following
example:
</p><p>

</p><pre>area/dark
   luminosity = 0

obj/torch
   icon = 'torch.dmi'
   luminosity = 3

turf
   floor
      icon = 'floor.dmi'
   wall
      icon = 'wall.dmi'
      density = 1

mob/DM
   key = "Dan"
   density = 0  //I can walk through walls!
</pre>
<p>
Make the necessary icons and a map.  Spread the dark area out over part of
the map to see what effect it has when you walk around in it.  If you change
the name of the DM's key to match your own, you should be able to walk
through walls.
</p><p>
If you play around with this code a bit, you will undoubtedly run into
things that you are not sure how to do yet.  For example, what if you want
the DM to be able to turn off the special ability of walking through walls
at will?  How about a command to create a torch with the wave of a hand?
Such actions require the stronger magic of verb procedures.  Read on!
