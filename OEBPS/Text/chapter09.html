<p>
</p><blockquote>  And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.  Come now
  therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will
  say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become
  of his dreams. 
</blockquote>
<center>--Genesis 37.19-20</center>

<p>
A client object is created when a player logs in and gets destroyed when
that player logs out.  Whereas a mob being used by a player and an NPC mob
are treated identically by the computer, the client datum contains
properties which are applicable only to players.
</p><p>
You may define verbs under the client data object.  These are treated just
like private verbs attached to the player's mob: they are accessible only to
the player and the source is implicit.  In addition to verbs, you may also
define client variables and procs.  The pre-defined ones will be described
in the sections that follow.
</p></a><p><a name="ClientChapter">
</a><a name="9.1">
</a></p>
<h3><a name="9.1">1. Client Variables</a></h3>
<a name="9.1">
</a><a name="ClientVars">
<p>
The client variables contain information about the player and the state of
the player's display.  They are described in the following list:
</p><p>

</p><p>

</p><li><b>key</b> is the name of the player's key.  This is used to connect the
player to a mob.  If a new mob is created for the player, the mob's name
will be set equal to the key.  By assigning this value to a mob's key, you
can cause the player to switch to that mob.  Any previous mob will lose the
key (by having its own key set to an empty text string).  The
<var>Login()</var> and <var>Logout()</var> procedures are called automatically
during this exchange.
<p>

</p></li><li><b>ckey</b> is the player's key in canonical form.  All punctuation is
stripped and letters are converted to lowercase.  This can be used for the
same purposes as <var>key</var> to cause players to switch mobs.  The primary
purpose, however, is for marking saved information about the player.
<p>

</p></li><li><b>mob</b> is the player's mob.  It can be directly assigned to cause the
player (and associated key) to get transferred to another mob.  This variable
is the complement of <var>mob.client</var>, which is a reference to the client
using the mob.
<p>

</p></li><li><b>eye</b> is the position at the center of the player's map.  By default it
is equal to the player's mob.  You could, however, set it equal to some
other object to control what the player sees.  Note, however, that
<em>visibility is still calculated from the mob's point of view</em>.  This
allows for effects like "lazy eye" which will be described next.
<p>

</p></li><li><b>lazy_eye</b> is the amount of lag between the player's eye and the
player's mob.  By default it is 0 so the mob stays centered.  If set to a
non-zero value, the mob can walk away from the center by the specified
amount before the view shifts it back to the center.
<p>

</p></li><li><b>dir</b> is the direction of "up" on on the player's screen.  By default
it is <var>NORTH</var>, which is the same as the map editor.  Other possible
values are <var>SOUTH</var>, <var>EAST</var>, and <var>WEST</var>.  Diagonals are
valid too, but will be approximated by one of the four cardinal directions.
The effect of each arrow key is automatically rotated along with the map.
<p>

</p></li><li><b>address</b> is the network address of the player.  If the world is
running directly in the client (the local server) this will be an empty text
string, which is sometimes useful for giving super-user access.  Otherwise,
this could be used to ban access from certain IP addresses if people from
there always turn out to be annoying.
<p>

</p></li><li><b>statobj</b> is the object being viewed by the player in the stat panels.
<p>

</p></li><li><b>statpanel</b> is the name of the stat panel currently visible to the
player.
<p>

</p></li></a><li><a name="ClientVars"><b>verbs</b> is the list of verbs attached to the client.  Verbs could be
added or removed from this list at run-time using techniques described
in section </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap10.html#VerbList">10.6.2</a>.
<p>

</p></li>
<li><b>script</b> specifies a DM Script program to send to the client when the
player connects.  The use and syntax of DM Script will be discussed in
section <a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap11.html#StyleSheets">11.5</a> and in the appendix (page
<a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/app4.html#DMScriptAppendix">[4]</a>).  Its primary purpose is to configure the
appearance of output text by using a style sheet.  Command aliases and
keyboard macros can also be defined.
<p>

</p></li>
<li><b>macro_mode</b> may be set to 1 to interpret keys as macros by default.
See the appendix (page <a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/app4.html#DMScriptAppendix">[4]</a>) for more information.
<p>

</p><p>
Using the <var>client.mob</var> variable, we can make a better <code>who</code> command
which only lists players who are currently logged in.
</p><p>

</p><pre>mob/verb/who()
   var/mob/M
   usr &lt;&lt; "Active players:"
   for(M)
      if(M.client)
         usr &lt;&lt; M.name
</pre>
<p>
Mobs without a client (i.e. NPCs) are excluded from the output list.
</p><p>
<a name="9.2">
</a></p><h3><a name="9.2">2. Client Procs</a></h3><a name="9.2">
</a><a name="ClientProcs">
<p>
There are a number of pre-defined procs which handle various forms of input
from the user.  These and other client procs are described in the following
sections.
</p></a><p><a name="ClientProcs">
</a><a name="9.2.1">
</a></p><h4><a name="9.2.1">2.1 Direction Procs</a></h4><a name="9.2.1">


<p>
When the player clicks an arrow key, this calls a corresponding client
proc.  There are procedures for each of the keys: <var>North</var>(),
<var>South</var>(), <var>East</var>(), <var>West</var>(), <var>Northeast</var>(),
<var>Northwest</var>(), <var>Southeast</var>(), <var>Southwest</var>(), and
<var>Center</var>().
</p><p>
It would be more precise to call these verbs, because that is in fact what
they are.  They just happen to be verbs with names starting with a dot, which
means they don't show up in any expansion lists until you type the dot.  So
you could type ".north" instead of clicking the up arrow if you really
wanted.  That is all the up arrow does for you.
</p><p>

</p><p>
By default, the directional procs call the client's <var>Move</var> proc,
which in turn calls the mob's own <var>Move</var> proc.  It is simply there to
redefine if you want.
</p><p>
</p><table align="center" border="1"><tbody><tr><td>
<table border="0">

<p></p></a><p><a name="9.2.1">
The <var>Center</var> proc also exists primarily for you to redefine.  The only
default action is to stop any automated movement of the player's mob.  That
topic will be discussed in section </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap14.html#MovementInstructions">14.2</a>.
</p><p>
In some games, you might want to disallow diagonal movements.  You could do
that by simply redefining the relevant procs to do nothing.
</p><p>

</p><pre>client
   //disable diagonals
   Northeast()
   Northwest()

</a><a name="ClientClick">

</a><p><a name="ClientClick">
The <var>Click</var> proc is called when the player clicks an object on the
map or in the stat panels.  There is an identical proc <var>DblClick</var>
which is activated by double-clicking.  The default action simply calls the
object's own <var>Click</var> or <var>DblClick</var> proc.  These object
procedures were described in section </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap07.html#ObjectClick">7.4</a>.

The following example tells you what you clicked.
</p><p>

</p><pre>client/Click(O)
   usr &lt;&lt; "You clicked [O]."
</pre>
<p>
Note that the default (parent) proc was not called in this example.  That
means the object's own <var>Click</var> procedure will not be called.  You
must remember to call <var>..()</var> if you wish this to still take place.
</p><p>
The client's <var>Click</var> procedure is convenient to use when you want to
perform an action that is the same for all types of objects.  When the
action depends on the type of object, the object's own <var>Click</var>
procedure is usually the better choice.
</p><p>
<a name="9.2.3">
</a></p><h4><a name="9.2.3">2.3 <var>Stat</var> proc</a></h4><a name="9.2.3">

</a><p><a name="9.2.3">
The <var>Stat</var> proc is called periodically by the client to refresh the
stat panels.  By default, this merely calls <var>statobj.Stat()</var>.  You
could generate stat output directly from this proc, but when the contents
reflect the status of another object (like the player's mob), this is
normally done in the object's own <var>Stat</var> proc.  Generation of stat
output was discussed in section </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap07.html#StatProc">7.3</a>.
</p><p>
<a name="9.2.4">
</a></p><h4><a name="9.2.4">2.4 <var>Topic</var> proc</a></h4><a name="9.2.4">

</a><a name="ClientTopic">
</a><p><a name="ClientTopic">
The <var>Topic</var> proc is activated by the player clicking on a topic link
embedded in the text output somewhere.  You could use it to give the player
more information on the indicated subject (hence the name <em>topic</em>).
However, there is no restriction on what action you may perform.  Some of
the possibilities will be explored in chapter </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap11.html#InputOutputChapter">11</a>.
</p><p>
</p><table align="center" border="1"><tbody><tr><td>
<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><td>
<var>Topic</var> </td>
<td> (Topic,Obj,SubTopic) </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
               </td>
<td> <code>Topic</code> is the topic link selected by the player. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
               </td>
<td> <code>Obj</code> is the object referenced if any. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
               </td>
<td> <code>SubTopic</code> is the <code>Obj</code> topic.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p></p><p>
The <code>Obj</code> and <code>SubTopic</code> parameters are only supplied if <code>Topic</code>
begins with an object reference (embedded with <code>\ref</code>).  By default,
the object's own <var>Topic</var> proc is called with <code>SubTopic</code> as the
argument.  You saw the result of that in section <a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap07.html#ObjectTopic">7.6</a> when we
created a link to a game object.
</p><p>
Since all topic links go through the client first, you have a chance to
control which objects a player may access.  You may also have topics which
do not really belong to any particular object.  In that case, you can just
handle them in the client object.
</p><p>
Topic hyperlinks are created in an HTML tag.  The syntax was already
introduced in connection with object links, but for client topics, you do not
necessarily have to insert an object reference.  It is also possible to use
this tag for other types of links.  The general syntax will be described in
section <a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap11.html#Link">11.2.8</a>.

<p></p><p>
As an example of a client topic link, you could give some advice to new
players.
</p><p>

</p><pre>client/Topic(T)
   if(T == "help")
      usr &lt;&lt; "The motto here is: you are what you eat."
   else ..()

mob/Login()
   ..()
   usr &lt;&lt; "When in doubt, click <a href="#help">here</a>."
</pre>
<p>
<a name="9.2.5">
</a></p><h4><a name="9.2.5">2.5 <var>Import</var> and <var>Export</var> procs</a></h4><a name="9.2.5">

<p>
The <var>Import</var> and <var>Export</var> procs are used to read and write to
a save file stored in the player's key file.  This is useful if the same
information about a player will be used in multiple worlds.  In that case,
rather than each world saving information about the player separately, it
can be attached to the player's key and carried from world to world that way.
</p></a><p><a name="9.2.5">
Since we haven't covered save files yet, further discussion of these procs
will be postponed until that time.  See chapter </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap12.html#SavefileChapter">12</a>.
</p><p>
<a name="9.2.6">
</a></p><h4><a name="9.2.6">2.6 <var>New</var> and <var>Del</var> procs</a></h4><a name="9.2.6">

<p>
The <var>New</var> and <var>Del</var> procs are called at creation and
destruction of the client, as they are for all objects.  The default
behavior of <var>New</var> is to connect the player to the mob with the same
key as the player.  If none is found, one will be created.  If there is a
mob defined to have the same key, that type of mob will be used; otherwise
world.mob is used.
</p><p>
</p><table align="center" border="1"><tbody><tr><td>
<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><td>
<var>New</var> </td>
<td> (Topic) </td>

<tr><td>
             </td>
<td> <code>Topic</code> is the initial topic being accessed. </td>

<tr><td>
             </td>

<p></p><p>
Normally an initial topic is not specified when a player connects.  However,
it may be useful in some situations.  By default, once a mob has been
selected, the <var>Topic</var> proc is called to handle it.
</p><p>
You could override the <var>New</var> proc to ban certain keys from connecting.
