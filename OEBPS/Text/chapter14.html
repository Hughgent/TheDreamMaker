<center>--Genesis 1.2</center>

<p>
The world map is a three-dimensional grid of turfs.  Three coordinates (that
is, numbers) are necessary to pinpoint the location of an individual turf in
the grid.  These have the symbolic names <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, and <var>z</var>.
</p><p>
The <var>x</var> coordinate specifies east-west positioning.  A value of 1 is
the western edge of the world and a value of <var>world.maxx</var> is the
eastern edge.  On the player's screen, <var>x</var> increases from left to
right.  The <var>y</var> coordinate goes from 1 in the south to
<var>world.maxy</var> in the north and normally increases from the bottom to
the top of the screen.
</p><p>
The <var>z</var> coordinate goes from 1 to <var>world.maxz</var> and often
represents high to low altitude.  However, the interpretation of <var>z</var>
is entirely up to your code since there are no built-in procedures that move
objects between <var>z</var>-levels.  Level 1 could be ground level and
subsequent levels could descend into the earth.  Or level 1 could be a world
map and the other levels could be detailed city maps.  It's entirely up to
you.  Most action takes place in the <var>x-y</var> plane because that is what
players can see.

<h3><a name="14.1">1. Spatial Instructions</a></h3>
<a name="14.1">
<p>
There are a number of instructions for working with coordinates and objects
on the map.  When you want to produce some sort of spatial effect, these are
the building blocks you will need.
</p></a><p><a name="14.1">

</a></p>
<h4><a name="14.1.1">1.1 <var>view</var> list</a></h4>
<a name="14.1.1">

<p>
The <var>view</var> instruction returns a list of all visible objects.  It is
often used without any arguments, but may take a range and center object as
parameters.
</p><p>
</p><table align="center" border="1"><tbody><tr><td>
<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><td>
<var>view</var> </td>
<td> (Range=world.view,Center=usr) </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
              </td>
<td> <code>Range</code> is the maximum distance to look. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
              </td>
<td> <code>Center</code> is the central object in the view. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
              </td>
<td> Returns a list of visible objects.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p></p><p>
The default view range may be adjusting by setting <var>world.view</var>.  The
default is 5, which gives you an 11x11 viewport.  However, you can increase
it up to a maximum of 10, which gives you a 21x21 viewport.  <small>(The
size of icons may be automatically scaled in order to conveniently fit the
map viewport on the player's screen.)</small>  
</p><p>
As a convenience, the arguments may be specified in any order.  This feature
is most often used when one wishes to specify a different center of view
while still using the default range.  For example, if you wanted <var>src</var>
rather than <var>usr</var> as the center, you could write <code>view(src)</code>
rather than <code>view(5,src)</code> or even <code>view(,src)</code>.
</p><p>
The range of -1 includes the center object and its contents.  A range of 0
adds the center object's turf or room and any other objects inside it.  A
range of 1 extends to the region on the map one square away from the center
(in a diagonal or straight direction).  A range of 2 includes the next line
of turfs and so on.  The default range of 5 includes the entire 11x11 map
seen by the player.

<p>
Portions of the view may be blocked by opaque objects.  Lighting also plays
a role.  If the background area lighting is on (<code>area.luminosity =
1</code>), all objects inside are illuminated.  Otherwise, individual turfs or
objects on the map may be luminous, lighting up themselves and the objects
around them.  If nothing is lit up, only the objects immediately around the
center (up to a distance of 1) are visible.
</p><p>
The way in which opaque objects affect the view is rather complicated.
Roughly speaking, opaque objects block the view of anything behind them.  To
improve the appearance of the view, any opaque objects on the edge of this
strictly visible region are also made visible.  This is known as
<em>boundary highlighting</em> and often yields a much improved effect.

<h4><a name="14.1.2">1.2 <var>oview</var> list</a></h4>
<a name="14.1.2">

<p>
The <var>oview</var> instruction is the same as <var>view</var> except it
excludes the center object and its contents.  In other words, it excludes
the objects in <code>view(-1)</code>.  This is most often useful when
broadcasting a message to everyone in view except the perpetrator of some
action.

<h5><a name="14.1.2.1">1.2.1 Point of View</a></h5>
<a name="14.1.2.1">

<p>
When describing events in the game to players, one may stick strictly to
third person or use a mixture of second and third person.  For example, when
a player smiles, everyone could see the text <code>"[usr] smiles"</code>, or
everyone but the player could see that and the player could instead see
<code>"You smile"</code>.
</p><p>
The advantage of a strict third person point of view is simplicity.  It tends
to have the feel of a story in which the player's mob is one of the
characters.  A second person point of view, on the other hand, is less like a
story and more like a play in which the player is actively taking one of the
roles.  It's up to you which effect you want.
</p><p>
Strict 3rd person output can simply be generated by broadcasting to all in
<var>view()</var>.  A second person point of view would instead use
<var>oview()</var>.  The following examples contrast the two methods.
</p><p>

</p><pre>//3rd person description
mob/verb/smile()
   view() &lt;&lt; "[usr] smiles."

//2nd person description
mob/verb/smile()
   usr &lt;&lt; "You smile."
   oview() &lt;&lt; "[usr] smiles."
</pre>
<p>
Commonly, actions involve three groups of people: one who performs an
action, another who is acted upon, and everyone else.  In a second person
system, the first two people would get a specially tailored second person
description and everyone else would get a third person description.
</p><p>
The following example demonstrates how this could be achieved.
</p><p>

</p><pre>mob/verb/smile(M as mob|null)
   if(!M) //no target mob specified
      usr &lt;&lt; "You smile."
      oview() &lt;&lt; "[usr] smiles."
   else
      usr &lt;&lt; "You smile at [M]."
      M &lt;&lt; "[usr] smiles at you."
      oview() - M &lt;&lt; "[usr] smiles at [M]."
</pre>
<p>
Recall that the <b>-</b> operator produces a list with the specified item
removed.  If that was not used in this example, the mob being smiled at
would see the third person description as well.

The <var>locate</var> instruction is used to get the reference of an object by

<p></p><p>
Using <var>locate()</var> one could place new players on the map at a specific
coordinate.  The following example moves them to the middle of the map
rather than the default position at (1,1,1).
</p><p>

</p><pre>mob/Login()
   if(!loc) //new player
      loc = locate(world.maxx/2,world.maxy/2,1)
</pre>
<p>
This is just one of many cases in which <var>locate()</var> is used to access
an object in the code that was created on the map using the map editor.
Rather than specify a coordinate, it is usually more convenient to use the
<var>tag</var> variable of the object.  This can be assigned to a special value
and used to find the object at run-time.
</p><p>
The following example moves new players to a specially tagged location.
</p><p>

</p><pre>mob/Login()
   if(!loc)
      loc = locate("start")
</pre>
</a><p><a name="14.1.4">
A turf would have to be tagged "start" for this to work.  Editing the tag

The following example uses this to find a particular turf in a region of the
map.
</p><p>

</p><pre>proc/LocateInLevel(Type,zLevel)
   var/SW = locate(1,1,zLevel)
   var/NE = locate(world.maxx,world.maxy,zLevel)
   return locate(Type) in block(SW,NE)
</pre>
<p>
This procedure could be used to connect z-levels of the map.  If each level
had one up-stairs and one down-stairs turf, these could be connected in the
following manner.
</p><p>

</p><pre>turf/downstairs
   verb/use()
      var/dest = LocateInLevel(/turf/upstairs,z+1)
      usr.Move(dest)

      var/dest = LocateInLevel(/turf/downstairs,z-1)
      usr.Move(dest)
</pre>
<p>
There are many other ways of making turfs which transport the user from one
location to another.  The destination could be in some fixed position
relative to the original turf (for example z+1 or z-1).  Another useful
method is to mark the destination with a special tag.

The three main groups are <var>walk</var>, <var>step</var>, and
<var>get_step</var>.  These each perform the same computation but differ in
how they apply the result.  The <var>walk</var> instructions continually move
an object, taking multiple steps if necessary.  The <var>step</var>
instructions do the same except only a single step is taken.  The
<var>get_step</var> instructions do not move any objects, but return the next
location that would be stepped to according to the given walking algorithm.
</p><p>
Which group of movement instructions you would want to use depends on how
much control you need to take over the process of moving an object.  The
<var>walk</var> group of instructions completely automates the movement,
whereas <var>step</var> allows you to control the timing yourself.  For
complete control, you can use <var>get_step</var> so that even the decision
about whether to move the object or not is left up to you.
</p><p>
The available walking algorithms are described in the following sections.
When a ready-made algorithm does not exist to suit your purpose, you may
still be able to use one of these in conjunction with your own additions.

<var>NORTHWEST</var>, <var>SOUTHEAST</var>, or <var>SOUTHWEST</var>.  These are
the same values used to indicate the direction an object is facing with the

The <var>step</var> instruction returns 1 on success and 0 on failure and

the background since it sleeps before each step.

Only one walking operation may be in effect at one time on a particular
object.  That means that when <var>walk</var> is invoked, any previous walking
operation on that object is aborted.  To clear any existing walking
operations, one can therefore specify no direction at all:
<code>walk(Obj,0)</code>.

The angle is specified in degrees.  For example, <code>turn(NORTH,90)</code>

well.

By changing the initial direction the guard is facing, he can be made to
pace in the desired line.  This example shows how you can use the existing
walking algorithms for your own purpose--in this case a linear pacing
algorithm.  Rotating by 90 degrees or 45 degrees instead would produce
motion in two dimensions instead of just one.  Of course then the guard
might wander off and neglect his duties!

One use for this would be a verb that allows a player to automatically
follow another one.  That can save a lot of needless key presses, which may
otherwise bog down the network.  Note that the command takes the player's
current distance from the target as the desired range to maintain so that
one can avoid crowding in on the leader.

As a convenience in situations like this, pressing any direction key will
stop the automated walking algorithm.  This applies even to the center key,
which merely calls <code>walk(src,0)</code> by default, allowing the player to
stop in place.

The <var>walk_rand</var>, <var>step_rand</var>, and <var>get_step_rand</var>

appears to wander aimlessly.  That is different from wandering
<em>mindlessly</em>, which would be the result of random movement.  In fact,
this algorithm is not very random but instead uses a technique known as
<em>edge following</em> to create the effect of purposeful motion.

The following example uses this walking algorithm to make certain mobs
meander through the world.
</p><p>

</p><pre>mob
   var/wander
   New()
      if(wander) walk_rand(src)
      ..()
</pre>
<p>
All you have to do to see this in action is define some mobs with the
<code>wander</code> variable initialized to 1.  The algorithm works best with some
edges to follow, so a maze-like map with many tunnels and rooms with walls
is ideal.

<h3><a name="14.3">3. Programming for Map Design</a></h3>
<a name="14.3">
</a><a name="Mapper">
<p>
In the simplest scenario, designing the world map is merely a matter of
selecting object types which were defined in the code and dropping them onto
the map.  The individual objects on the map are called <em>instances</em> of
the object types and as a group are referred to as the initial map population.
</p><p>
Depending on your preference, it is possible to do little or all of the map
design from the code.  By creating turfs and other objects with
<var>new()</var> part or all of the map could be generated at run-time.  Since
this is a rather cumbersome method, it is usually reserved for cases where
the map is laid out according to some algorithm.  For example, a maze-like
map could be randomly generated so that it is different each time it is
played.
</p><p>
Map generating algorithms are an interesting topic, but the techniques
involved are fairly abstract and rely very little on the particulars of the
DM language.  For an example, refer to the DM Code Library.  One of the
useful items to be found there is the "Amazing Maze Generator," which can
make seemingly infinite dungeons and the like.
</p><p>

In most situations, map design is done principally in the map editor.  It is
even possible to go beyond simply using pre-defined object types.  Using the
map editor's instance editing feature, you can modify individual objects to
suit your own purposes.  This allows one to avoid cluttering up the code
with object types which are really just minor variations of a more general
type but which are required to make instances on the map.
</p></a><p><a name="Mapper">
Using the map editor to its fullest potential, one can write code which is
fairly general and independent of the map.  This is especially convenient
when the programmer and map designer are different people.  In fact, the
code can be written once and used to design many different maps.  This
process is referred to as writing a world <em>code base</em> which is then used
to create an endless variety of world <em>instances</em>.  These could be
networked together using techniques described in section </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap12.html#World2World">12.6</a>.
</p>
<p>
The map instance editor allows one to modify the object's variables.  For
example, you can change the name of an object, its icon, its density, and so
forth.  There is no limitation to built-in variables; those defined in the
code may also be modified.  In this case you may wish to specify what sort
of value may be given to the variable.  This prevents mistakes and also
helps inform the map designer about a variable without requiring the poor
fellow to read the code.

<h4><a name="14.3.1">3.1 Variable Input Parameters</a></h4>
<a name="14.3.1">

<p>
Object variables may be declared in much the same way as verb arguments to
provide extra information to the map editor.  Both the input type and a list
of possible values may be specified.  Otherwise a variable simply defaults
to accept any type of value.

The valid input types include all those which may be used in a verb argument
definition.  These are described in section </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap04.html#InputTypes">4.5.1</a>.  The list of
possible values can be a list of constants or a range of integers.  The
following example demonstrates both possibilities.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<pre>mob/var

<p>
Dream Maker's instance editor is a powerful tool, if used appropriately.  It
can allow you to quickly make unique entities without having to derive new
classes for everything.  It is also quite simple to use, requiring no other
coding knowledge than the ability to fill out forms.  Consider the previous
code:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<pre>mob/var
  wealth as num
  strength in 1 to 100
  alignment in list("good","bad","neutral")
  background as text
</pre>
<p>
Now suppose you have derived a monster type from this, say,
<code>/mob/goblin</code>.  Using the instance editor, you can place a bunch of
unique goblins on the map without having to modify the DM code one bit:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<p>
</p>
<li>Select the <code>goblin</code> type in the tree.
<p>
</p></li>
<li>Click on the <b>Edit</b> button in the adjacent panel.  This will
bring up a dialog with the properties of the goblin.
<p>
</p></li>
<li>Modify these properties by changing the values in the form.  If you
enter invalid values, the editor will correct you.  It does this by looking
at the specified filters.  For instance, the <code>strength</code> property must be
a value between 1 and 100.  If it is not in this range, it must be reset.  In
this fashion, you can change names, descriptions, icons, and so on.  You can
make a horde of goblins, each with unique identifications and traits.
<p>
</p></li>
<li>One particular useful property is the <var>tag</var>.  This is just a text
string that can be used to distinguish instances in the <var>locate()</var>
instruction.  So if you want to make a "chief goblin" without deriving a
new type, you might want to set the tag to "chief goblin" and set the other
properties accordingly.  You can then locate this goblin later on by doing
<code>locate("chief goblin")</code>.
<p>
</p></li>
<li>After you are done editing the goblins, place them on the map by
selecting the corresponding instance in the panel (they will be sorted by
tag).  If you want to re-edit them later, you can use the <b>Look</b>
option and proceed from there.
<p>
</p></li>
</ol>
