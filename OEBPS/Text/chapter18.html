<blockquote>  He touched the fish, saying in a terrible voice, `Fish, fish, are you
  doing your duty?' To these words the fish lifting up their heads replied,
  `Yes, yes.  If you reckon, we reckon.  If you pay your debts, we pay
  ours.  If you fly, we conquer, and are content.'

<p>
Most of the time, the data objects you create will be pre-defined, or at
least derived from one of the pre-defined types.  However, it is possible to
make your own datum from scratch.  Such an object may be useful for
your own specialized purpose when you don't need all the extra baggage
associated with the built-in types.

<h3><a name="18.1">1. Defining a Datum</a></h3>
<a name="18.1">
<p>
To define a new data type, simply derive it from the root, rather than from
an existing object type.  The following code demonstrates the syntax by
defining a <code>Quest</code> datum.
</p><p>

</p><pre>Quest
   var
      mob/sponsor
      quest_obj_type
      reward_obj_type
      desc

   proc
      Check()
         var/mob/M
         var/obj/O
         for(M in view(sponsor,1))
            O = locate(quest_obj_type) in M
            if(O)
               Reward(M,O)
               return 1
      Reward(mob/M,obj/O)
         var/obj/R = new reward_obj_type(M)
         O.Move(sponsor)
         M &lt;&lt; "You have completed the quest!"
         M &lt;&lt; "[sponsor] takes [O] and rewards you with \an [R]."
</pre>
<p>
As you can see, object variables and procs are defined just as with any
other data object.  Inheritance works the same too, so you can derive new
types from ones you have already defined.

<h3><a name="18.2">2. Object Variables</a></h3>
<a name="18.2">
<p>
Generic data objects are intended to have as small of a pre-defined
"footprint" as possible.  As a result, there are very few built-in
variables.  These are described in the following list.
</p><p>

</p><p>

</p><li><b>type</b> contains the type path of the object.
<p>

</p></li><li><b>tag</b> contains an optional unique text identifier for the object.
Once you have assigned this, you may use <var>locate(<it>tag</it>)</var> to get
a reference to the datum.
<p>

</p></li></a><li><a name="18.2"><b>vars</b> is the list of variables belonging to the object.  The
items in the list are the variable names.  Each one is associated with the
value of the variable itself.  See section </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap12.html#AdvancedSavefiles">12.7</a> for an
example.

</a></p><h3><a name="18.3">3. Object Procedures</a></h3><a name="18.3">

</a><p><a name="18.3">
There are only a few pre-defined procedures for data objects.  These all
have the same meaning as for the atomic objects which have already been
introduced.  Figure </a><a href="#AbstractProcs">18.27</a> lists the procedures and the page
where you may find a full description.

</a></p><h3><a name="18.4">4. Creation of Data Objects</a></h3><a name="18.4">

<p>
The <var>new</var> instruction is used to create data objects and <var>del</var>
is used to destroy them.  The following example shows how the previously
defined quest object might be used.
</p><p>

</p><pre>mob/king
   var/quests[0]

   verb/beg()  //get a new quest
      set src in view()
      var/Quest/q = RandQuest()
      usr &lt;&lt; q.desc
      quests += q

   verb/bow()  //finish quest
      set src in view()
      var/Quest/q
      for(q in quests)
         if(q.Check())
            quests -= q
            return
</pre>

<pre>   proc/RandQuest()
      var/qtype = pick(typesof(/Quest) - /Quest)
      var/Quest/q = new qtype()
      q.sponsor = src
      return q
</pre>

<pre>Quest/Goblin
   quest_obj_type = /obj/corpse/goblin
   reward_obj_type = /obj/potion/newlife
   desc = "Bring us the head of a goblin and ye shall have new life!"

Quest/Ring
   quest_obj_type = /obj/magic_ring
   reward_obj_type = /obj/wand/lightning
   desc = "Bring us a golden ring and thy reward shall be great!"
</pre>
<p>
By begging the king, one receives a new quest.  With the requested object
in hand, one must simply bow before the king to receive the reward.  The
<var>typesof</var> instruction was used here to pick a quest randomly from all
that are defined in the code.
</p><p>
Obviously one could add all sorts of improvements to this basic system.  For
example, other types of rewards and requests could be added.  However, it is
a good start and a nice demonstration of a user-defined datum.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Note that we never bothered to delete the quest when it was finished but
simply remove it from the list.  Since there are no longer any references to
the object anywhere, it will be automatically deleted by the garbage
collector.
