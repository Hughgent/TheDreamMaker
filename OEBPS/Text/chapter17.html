<p>
The aspects of the language covered so far have mostly been operations which
take place in the isolated realm of the world.  This chapter covers the
additional commands which make it possible to interact with the rest of the
computer, including access to files, programs, and other BYOND worlds.

<h3><a name="17.1">1. A Note on Platform Independence</a></h3>
<a name="17.1">

<p>
The operating system running on a computer is called the <em>platform</em> by
programmers.  At the present moment, BYOND can be used in both the Microsoft
Windows and UNIX operating systems.  Additional versions are in progress for
other systems.
</p><p>
Whenever possible, it is better to write programs that are <em>platform
independent</em>, which means they will work the same in any operating system.
The DM language practically guarantees this by providing a syntax which
relies as little as possible on the peculiarities of the external
computational environment.  In fact, the BYOND system behaves in many ways
like a virtual operating system, insulating your code from the real
operating system, and thus providing the same environment regardless of the
machine it is running on.
</p><p>

</p><p>
However, in order to provide access to files and other programs on the
computer, some platform dependencies are necessary.  For example, the file
names in UNIX are case-sensitive whereas in Windows they are not.  That
means when specifying a file name in a Windows environment you could get
away with any combination of upper and lower case, whereas if you run the
same code in UNIX it will only work if the case matches the name of the file
exactly.  It is therefore good practice to at least be consistent and use
the same case throughout your code when referring to the same file.
</p><p>
File paths are relative to the current directory (unless an absolute path is
given).  The current directory is always the same directory as the world
<tt>dmb</tt> file.  On a UNIX platform, the <b>/</b> character is used in
paths after each sub-directory.  Normally, in Windows one would use the
<b>\</b> character for this purpose; however, DM allows you to
use the <b>/</b> character instead.  This is more convenient because it is
not treated as a special character inside a text string.

<h3><a name="17.2">2. <var>shell</var></a></h3>
<a name="17.2">

<p>
The <var>shell</var> instruction passes a command to the operating system.
The command interpreter is often called a <em>shell</em>--hence the name for
this instruction.  This is a sleeping call which only returns after the
operation has finished.

The syntax of the command is obviously entirely operating system dependent.
It normally consists of a program name followed by a number of arguments.
If the command generates output or expects input, you will need to redirect
the input and output to files, which in UNIX and Windows is done with the
<b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b> operators.
</p><p>
The following example runs the "dir" command and displays the result.
</p><p>

</p><pre>mob/verb/list_files()
   shell("dir &gt; dir.txt")
   usr &lt;&lt; browse("dir.txt")

The <var>file</var> instruction returns a reference to a file object.  The
primary use for such an object is with the input/output operators.
Outputting a file to a player was discussed in section </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap11.html#FileOutput">11.2.7</a>.  It
is also possible to send output to a file or get input from a file.

<p>
Using a file as the target for output of the <b>&lt;&lt;</b>
operator has the same effect as calling <var>text2file()</var>.  The output
value is appended to the file.  Similarly, reading input from a file with
the <b>&gt;&gt;</b> operator is the same as
<var>file2text()</var>.  The file is loaded into a text string and stored in
the specified variable.

Only files and sub-directories directly contained in the specified path are
listed (i.e. not the contents of the sub-directories too).  The file names in
the list do not contain the path information but just the bare file name.
Sub-directories in the list are identified by a trailing "<tt>/</tt>"
appended to the name.
</p><p>
The format of the path is "<tt>dir1/dir2/.../file</tt>".  Only files
matching "<tt>file</tt>" are listed, so be sure to append a "<tt>/</tt>"
to the end of a directory name if you wish to see its contents.  Otherwise,
all you will get is the directory name back with a "<tt>/</tt>" appended.

<h3><a name="17.10">10. Running other Worlds</a></h3>
<a name="17.10">
<p>
It is sometimes desirable for one master world to launch child worlds.  For
example, you might have a main world with side-adventures (dungeons etc.)
taking place in separate sub-worlds.  This might be more efficient since
areas that are rarely used could be activated only when needed.
</p><p>
The ultimate use of this technique is a world hosting service which allows
users to upload their own world files.  These are then launched and shut
down as they are accessed by players.  If you do not have your own dedicated
network connection, you may wish to make use of such a service to host your
worlds.

<p></p><p>
The network address of a world includes two parts.  The first is the IP
address of the machine it is running on.  The second is the port number.
These are combined in a text string of the form "ip:port".  The port
specified must not be in use by any other programs.  The default value of
zero indicates that any available port should be used.
</p><p>
The additional options that may be specified are described in the following
list.
</p><p>

</p><p>
</p><li><b>-once</b> This option automatically shuts down the server when all
players have logged off.
<p>

</p></li><li><b>-log</b> This option takes an additional argument which is used as the
server's output file.  All debugging notices (from proc crashes) and any
output sent to <code>world.log</code> is appended to this file.  The path to the
file is relative to the new server's working directory, which is the
location of the <tt>.dmb</tt> file.
<p>

</p></li><li><b>-safe</b> This option runs the world in a special protective security
mode.  The world code may only access files in the same directory (or below)
as the <tt>.dmb</tt> file and access to the <var>shell</var> instruction is
disabled.  This is the default mode if the world is run from its own safe
directory.  Such a directory is recognized when it has the same name as the
world <tt>.dmb</tt> file (e.g. <tt>inferno/inferno.dmb</tt>).
<p>
</p></li><li><b>-ultrasafe</b> This is the same as <var>-safe</var> except only access to
temporary files is allowed.  This is the default if the world is not run
from its own safe directory.
<p>
</p></li><li><b>-trusted</b> In this mode, all operations are permitted.  The world may
access files in any directory and may run <var>shell</var> commands.  Of
course the operating system may apply restrictions, but BYOND will allow the
world to try anything.
<p>

</p></li></a><li><a name="17.10.1"><b>-params</b> The following argument is interpreted as a parameter string
as described in section </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap10.html#ParameterLists">10.9</a>.  The variable
<var>world.params</var> is initialized from this data.  You may use
<var>-params</var> multiple times; the individual parameter strings are
simply concatenated to form the final result.

normally displays when it boots up.

</a><p><a name="17.10.2">
Communication with a child world may be done through
<var>world.Export()</var>.  In this case, the child world's
<var>world.Topic()</var> procedure is called with a special <code>master</code> flag
to indicate that the message came from the world which started it.  (See
section </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap08.html#WorldTopicProc">8.2.4</a> for a review of these procs.)
</p><p>
By default, a child world will respond to the special topics "Del" and
"Reboot" by calling <var>world.Del()</var> and <var>world.Reboot()</var>
respectively.  This is only done if the message comes from the master world,
since otherwise anyone could send the message and shut your world down.

Another useful topic is "ping", which can be used to determine if a child
world is still alive and running.

The address should be the same text string returned by <var>startup()</var>.
If the second argument is omitted or zero, this is equivalent to calling
<var>world.Export()</var> with the given address and <code>"Del"</code> as the
topic.  Otherwise, this instruction simply waits for the child world to die
naturally of its own accord.
</p><p>
With no arguments at all, this instruction causes the current world to shut
down.  The same thing can be achieved by calling <var>world.Del()</var>.
