</p><blockquote>  It can happen--if you practice the Art of Memory--that the symbols you put
  next to one another will modify themselves without your choosing it, and
  that when next you call them forth, they may say something new and
  revelatory to you, something you didn't know you knew.
</blockquote>
<center>--<i>John Crowley</i>, Little Big</center>

<p>
So far the examples given have been quite small and would therefore be most
easily handled in a single <tt>.dm</tt> code file.  However, for large
projects, it may be advantageous to split your code up into several files.
For example, the basic combat system might be defined in one file, monsters
in another, magic scrolls in another, and so on.  In some cases, different
people may be working on various aspects of the project, making it
convenient to split the code along those lines.
</p><p>
Another reason to use multiple files is to write code which can be re-used
in multiple projects.  Such files are often called <em>library</em> files.
You may define such files yourself or you may use some that other people
have created.

<h3><a name="19.1">1. Including Files</a></h3>
<a name="19.1">

<p>
The contents of one source file may be inserted into another by using the
<var>#include</var> command.  There are two forms depending on where you want
the compiler to look for the file.  In one case it only looks in the library
directory and in the other it looks in the current directory first and then
in the library directory if necessary.
</p><p>
</p><table align="center" border="1"><tbody><tr><td>
<table border="0">

<p></p><p>
If the same file is included multiple times, only the first request is
processed.  This prevents trouble in cases where several files in a project
all include the same library file.
</p><p>
All projects implicitly include the file
<tt>&lt;stddef.dm&gt;</tt> at the top of the code.  This file
defines a few standard constants and makes some basic definitions.
</p><p>
Besides inserting source code files (ending in <tt>.dm</tt>), the
<var>#include</var> command is also used to attach map files (ending in
<tt>.dmm</tt>) to a project.  The syntax is the same in either case.  Map
files are inserted into the main world map in successive z-levels and the x-y
boundaries of the main map are automatically adjusted to fit the largest map
which is included.
</p><p>

<p>
If you are using the Dream Maker interface to manage your project, you will
very rarely have to use the standard <var>#include</var> and
<var>#define</var> <var>FILE_DIR</var> macros.  The reason is that Dream Maker
automates these functions through the interface.
</p><p>
As mentioned earlier, code and map files are included by selecting the
corresponding check-boxes in the file tree.  The file referencing is handled
with similar ease.  All files in the project directory and below are
automatically recognized without the need to supply directories or manually
create <var>FILE_DIR</var> entries.  For instance, if your project is in the
directory <tt>world</tt>, you may access the file
<tt>world/icons/mobs/warrior.dmi</tt> by simply supplying the name,
<tt>warrior.dmi</tt>.

One time when you might need to use <var>#include</var> directly is to force
a file to be processed before the code which follows.  Section

code does matter.

<h3><a name="19.2">2. The Preprocessor</a></h3>
<a name="19.2">

<p>
The <var>#include</var> command is one of several <em>preprocessor</em>
commands.  They all begin with "<b>#</b>" and are placed on a line by
themselves.  <small>(The DM preprocessor is identical to the one used in C
and C++ compilers.  The commands are often called <em>preprocessor
directives</em> by C programmers.)</small>   The preprocessor handles such commands while
the code file is initially being read and can be used to alter the
appearance of the file as seen by the compiler.  Additional preprocessor
commands will be described in the following sections.
</p></a><p><a name="19.2">
</a><a name="19.2.1">
</a></p>
<h4><a name="19.2.1">2.1 <var>#define</var></a></h4>
<a name="19.2.1">

<p>
The <var>#define</var> command creates a preprocessor macro.  Any subsequent
occurrences of the macro in the code will be replaced by the contents of the
macro.  Places where the macro occurs as part of another word or inside a
text string do not count and will not be substituted.
</p><p>
</p><table align="center" border="1"><tbody><tr><td>
<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><td>
<var>#define</var> </td>
<td> Name Value </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
                  </td>
<td> <code>Name</code> is the macro name. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
                  </td>
<td> <code>Value</code> is the text to substitute in its place.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p></p><p>
This and all other preprocessor commands are terminated by the end of the
line.  Therefore, if you wish to extend it onto multiple lines, you must use
<b>\</b> to escape the end of the line.
</p><p>
The name of the macro may consist of upper and lowercase letters as well as
digits and the underscore, as long as the first character is not a digit.
By convention, macros are often named in all uppercase, but this is not a
requirement.
</p><p>
It is also possible to have the macro take arguments which may then be
substituted into the replacement text as desired.
</p><p>
</p><table align="center" border="1"><tbody><tr><td>
<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><td>
<var>#define</var> </td>
<td> Name(Arg1,Arg2,...) Value </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
                  </td>
<td> <code>Arg1</code> is the name of the first argument. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
                  </td>
<td> <code>Arg2</code> is the name of the second argument, etc.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p></p><p>
Wherever the argument names appear in the replacement text, they will be
replaced by the values passed to the macro when it is used.  Such a macro
can be used like a procedure, but since it operates at the textual level, it
is possible to do things which would not be possible with a procedure.
</p><p>
Care should be taken when using macros in expressions.  Since the macro
substitution simply inserts text from one place into another there is no
guarantee that expressions within the macro will be evaluated before being
combined with an outer expression.  To be safe, you can put parenthesis
around macro expressions to ensure they do not get combined in some
unforeseen way with the external code.
</p><p>
The following code, for example, uses this technique to prevent the bitshift
operator <b>&lt;&lt;</b> from taking a lower order of operations
when the macro is used in some larger expression.
</p><p>

</p><pre>#define FLAG1 (1&lt;&lt;0)
#define FLAG2 (1&lt;&lt;1)
#define FLAG3 (1&lt;&lt;2)

<h4><a name="19.2.2">2.2 Special Macros</a></h4>
<a name="19.2.2">
<p>
There are a few macros with special meanings.  These are described in the
following sections.
</p></a><p><a name="19.2.2">
</a><a name="19.2.2.1">
</a></p>
<h5><a name="19.2.2.1">2.2.1 <var>FILE_DIR</var></a></h5>
<a name="19.2.2.1">

<p>
The <var>FILE_DIR</var> macro defines the search path for resource files (i.e.
files in single quotes).  Unlike most macros, it may be defined multiple
times in a cumulative fashion.  Subsequent definitions simply add to the
list of paths to search.
</p><p>
</p><table align="center" border="1"><tbody><tr><td>
<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><td>
<var>#define</var> </td>
<td> <var>FILE_DIR</var> Path </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
                  </td>
<td> <code>Path</code> is the location of resource files.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p></p><p>
By using this macro, you can avoid entering the full path to resource files
but can instead just enter the name of the file and let the compiler find it
for you.  Of course this would lead to confusion if the files in all the
specified locations do not have unique names.  If that happens, the first
one found will be used.
</p><p>
The following example is a typical case.  It simply defines two
directories--one for icons and one for sounds.
</p><p>

</p><pre>#define FILE_DIR icons
#define FILE_DIR sounds
</pre>
</a><p><a name="19.2.2.1">
</a><a name="19.2.2.2">
</a></p>
<h5><a name="19.2.2.2">2.2.2 <var>DEBUG</var></a></h5>
<a name="19.2.2.2">

<p>
The <var>DEBUG</var> macro enables the inclusion of extra debugging
information in the dmb file.  This makes the file bigger and will result in
very slightly slower execution of procedures.  However, the advantage is that
when a proc crashes, it will tell you the source file and line number where
the problem occurred.  Without the extra debugging information, only the
name of the procedure is reported.

It doesn't matter if you give <var>DEBUG</var> a value or not.  Just defining
it turns on debugging mode.

</a></p>
<h5><a name="19.2.2.3">2.2.3 <var>__FILE__</var></a></h5>
<a name="19.2.2.3">

<p>
The <var>__FILE__</var> macro is replaced by a text string containing the
name of the current source file.  This may be useful when generating
debugging error messages.
</p></a><p><a name="19.2.2.3">
</a><a name="19.2.2.4">
</a></p>
<h5><a name="19.2.2.4">2.2.4 <var>__LINE__</var></a></h5>
<a name="19.2.2.4">

<p>
The <var>__LINE__</var> macro is replaced by the number of the current
source line being read.  This too may be useful when generating debugging
error messages.  The following example demonstrates this.
</p><p>

</p><pre>proc/MyProc()
   //blah blah

   world.log &lt;&lt; "[__FILE__]:[__LINE__]: We got this far!"

<h5><a name="19.2.2.5">2.2.5 <var>DM_VERSION</var></a></h5>
<a name="19.2.2.5">

<p>
The <var>DM_VERSION</var> macro is the version number of the compiler (217 at
the time I am writing).  This could be used by library writers when the code
requires new language features that were not available before a certain
version or if the syntax changed in some way.  By using conditional
compilation or the <var>#error</var> command, one could make the library code
adapt to earlier versions of the compiler just in case someone tries to use
one.
</p></a><p><a name="19.2.2.5">
</a><a name="19.2.3">
</a></p>
<h4><a name="19.2.3">2.3 <var>#undef</var></a></h4>
<a name="19.2.3">

<p>
The <var>#undef</var> command removes a macro.  In the code that follows, the
macro will no longer be substituted.  This could be used at the end of
library files to prevent any macros that are used internally from taking
effect in the code that includes them.
</p></a><p><a name="19.2.3">
</a><a name="19.2.4">
</a></p>
<h4><a name="19.2.4">2.4 Conditional Compilation</a></h4>
<a name="19.2.4">
<p>
The preprocessor can be used to skip sections of code conditionally.  The
condition usually depends on the existence or value of other macros.  In
this way you can turn on or off features in the code by configuring a few
macro definitions at the top of the project.
</p><p>
The commands for conditionally compiling code are described in the following
sections.
</p></a><p><a name="19.2.4">
</a><a name="19.2.4.1">
</a></p>
<h5><a name="19.2.4.1">2.4.1 <var>#ifdef</var></a></h5>
<a name="19.2.4.1">

<p>
The <var>#ifdef</var> command compiles the code which follows only if the
specified macro has been defined.  The section is terminated by the
<var>#endif</var> command.

</p><table align="center" border="1"><tbody><tr><td>
<table border="0">

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p></p><p>
There is also a <var>#ifndef</var> command which has the opposite effect.
The code that follows is only compiled if the macro is <em>not</em> defined.
</p><p>

</p><p>
The <var>DEBUG</var> macro is sometimes used to turn on certain debugging
features in the code.  The following example demonstrates this technique.
</p><p>

</p><pre>#ifdef DEBUG
mob/verb/GotoMob(mob/M in world)
   set category = "Debugging"

<h5><a name="19.2.4.2">2.4.2 <var>#if</var></a></h5>
<a name="19.2.4.2">

<p>
The <var>#if</var> command is a more general version of the <var>#ifdef</var>
command because it can take any expression involving other macros and
constants.  If the expression is true, the code which follows is compiled.
Otherwise it is skipped.  Alternate conditions can be supplied with the
<var>#elif</var> command and a final section to be compiled if all else fails
may follow the <var>#else</var> command.

<p></p><p>
The condition may involve any of the basic operators but usually only uses
the boolean operators.  One addition is the <var>defined</var> instruction
which tests if the specified macro has been defined.

<p></p><p>
One common use of the <var>#if</var> command is to block out a section of
code.  This is sometimes done in the course of debugging or possibly to turn
off a feature without throwing away the code.  The following example
demonstrates this technique.
</p><p>

</p><pre>#if 0
   //Disabled code.
#endif
</pre>
<p>
Since DM allows comments to be nested (one inside another) it is also
possible to accomplish the same thing by putting <code>/* */</code> around the
disabled code.  It is a C programmer's habit to use the <var>#if</var>
command because many C compilers get confused by nested comments.

if something is wrong.

<h3><a name="19.3">3. Some Code Management Issues</a></h3>
<a name="19.3">
<p>
There are a few things to keep in mind when working with large DM projects.
First and foremost one must strive for simplicity.  The art of programming
is mostly a matter of realizing your own limitations and compensating for
them.
</p><p>
If, as the project grows, each new piece of code depends upon the details of
every previous piece of code, the complexity of the project is growing
exponentially.  Before you know it, the code will rise up in revolt and
stick you in a dark smelly dungeon.  End of story.
</p><p>
Fortunately, most programming tasks do not require exponential complexity.
With a good design, you can split the project into pieces which interact
with each other in a fairly simple way.  These pieces are often called
modules which is why this practice is termed <em>modular
programming</em>.  <small>(It is interesting to note, however, that all such
schemes to avoid exponentially complex code ultimately fail.  They only move
the exponential growth to a higher level--from individual statements to
procedures to objects and on and on.  It may be true that complexity will
always win out in the end and that every project undergoing perpetual growth
must periodically be redesigned from scratch in order to remain
comprehensible.  Or perhaps this tendency is merely the result of a periodic
increase in wisdom to offset the inevitable decline in intelligence.  In my
own case, I know this to be a prominent factor.)</small>  
</p><p>
Although the term <em>module</em> can refer to any unit of code, it most often
is embodied by a file or group of files.  The <em>public</em> parts of the
module are those procedures, variables, and object types which are
advertised for use by code outside the module.  This is called the module
<em>interface</em> and defines the syntax for putting information in and
getting results out of the module.  All other <em>private</em> material is
considered internal to the module and is not for use by outside code.
</p><p>
When devising a project, one should foresee the function of the different
component modules and have a rough idea of the interface to each one.  When
work commences on a module, it is worth putting a description of the public
interface in a comment at the top of the file.  This helps focus development
along lines consistent with a good clean interface.  You will also find it a
useful reference in the future when you or someone else needs to use the
module.  You won't need to page through expanses of code to figure out how
to operate your wonderful gadget.
</p></a><p><a name="19.3">

</a></p>
<h4><a name="19.3.1">3.1 Ordering Code</a></h4>
<a name="19.3.1">
</a><a name="CodeOrder">
<p>
In many cases, the sequential order of DM code makes no difference.  For
example, a procedure, variable, or object type may be defined before or
after being used in the code.  This is different from some languages which
require every symbol to be defined prior to being used.
</p><p>
There are a few cases, however, when the order of code does matter.  The
preprocessor, for example, operates strictly sequentially from top to bottom
of the code.  The principle consequence of this is that macro definitions
must precede their use.  This is one good reason to instead use constant
variables for the purpose when it is possible.
</p><p>
Another time when code sequence matters is when overriding object procedures
or variable initializations.  If the same procedure is overridden several
times in the same object type, subsequent versions take precedence and will
treat previous ones as their parent procedure.
</p><p>

</p><p>
One might, for example, add functionality to the <var>client.Topic()</var>
procedure in several different locations in the code.  As long as you
remember to execute the parent procedure each time, the additions are
cumulative.
</p><p>

</p><pre>client/Topic(T)
   if(T == "introduction")
      usr &lt;&lt; "Once upon a time..."
   else ..()

client/Topic(T)
   if(T == "help")
      usr &lt;&lt; "The situation is helpless."
   else ..()
</pre>
<p>
As written, these two definitions of the <var>Topic</var> procedure can fall in
any order with any amount of intervening code.  If one of them neglected to
call <var>..()</var>, however, it would disable any previous versions of the
procedure.  It is therefore good practice to always call the parent
procedure unless you specifically wish to disable it.  Then you don't have
to worry about maintaining any special order of the procedures.

Bugs happen.  Actually that is an understatement in large projects.  Bugs
happen frequently.  This is fortunate, because there is nothing more
satisfying than exterminating a bug.

</a></p>
<h5><a name="19.3.2.1">3.2.1 Good Coding Habits</a></h5>
<a name="19.3.2.1">
<p>
The novice programmer has far too much faith in the compiler.  The veteran
bug hunter, however, knows that just because the code compiles doesn't mean
it works.  It could still be infested with potential problems.
</p><p>
The first rule for successful debugging is to compile the code yourself.  Of
course you do not need to generate the byte code by hand; that's what the
compiler is for.  Compiling the code yourself means reading through the code
you have written as though you were the compiler and making sure what the
compiler sees matches what you intended.
</p><p>
The second good debugging habit is to run the code yourself.  Initialize the
necessary variables to some typical values and step through the procedure in
your mind.  The server can catch simple errors, but only you know what the
code is <em>supposed</em> to do, so only you can tell the difference between
code which runs and code which actually works.  After doing a typical case,
also be sure to think through any exceptional cases which may occur.  For
example, with a loop, you should verify that the first and last iteration
will operate as expected.
</p><p>
After doing these pre-checks, it is, of course, vital to test the code for
real.  This is known as <em>beating</em> on the code.  Don't be gentle.  Treat
it roughly to expose any unforeseen weaknesses.  If it is code which responds
to user input, try doing the usual things and then try things you wouldn't
normally expect.
</p><p>
Code which has passed these three tests will be reasonably sound.  By
catching bugs early, you save yourself a lot of trouble, because the code is
fresh in your mind and therefore easier to decipher.  Besides, you will find
that deciphering bug reports from other users can be even harder!

<h5><a name="19.3.2.2">3.2.2 Elusive Bugs</a></h5>
<a name="19.3.2.2">

<p>
Even when you have been careful, some subtle problems may still
occasionally slip through.  Hunting them down can be a frustrating
experience, so it is good to have a few tricks up the sleeve.
</p><p>
There are two types of bugs: proc crashers and silent errors.  Those that
crash procs are the result of some exceptional case occurring.  For example,
the code might be trying to access an object's variable but the object
reference is <var>null</var>.  Allowing this sort of case to silently slide by
(by pretending the variable of the non-existent object is <var>null</var>, for
example) might be a convenient thing to do in some cases, but in others it
might cover up a genuine error that needs to be corrected by the
programmer.  Crashing the procedure and reporting the problem therefore
makes it much easier for you to discover the problem and find its source.
</p><p>

</p><p>
When the procedure crashes, some diagnostic information is output to
<var>world.log</var>.  When running the world directly in the client, this
information is displayed directly in the terminal window.  With a
stand-alone server, it is normally in the server's output but may be
redirected to a file.
</p><p>
The most important part of the diagnostic information is the name of the
procedure that crashed.  The value of the <var>src</var> and <var>usr</var>
variables are also included.  If there are any procedures in the call stack
(that is, the procedure which called this one, and the procedure which in
turn called it, and so on) these are displayed.

If this is not enough information for you to locate the source of the
problem, try compiling the world with the <var>DEBUG</var> macro defined.  This
will add source file and line number information to the diagnostic output.
</p><p>
One may also need to probe around in the code to see what is going on.  This
can be accomplished by sending your own diagnostic information to
<var>world.log</var>.  For example, you might to know the value of a variable
at a particular point in the code.  This could be done with a line like the
following:
</p><p>

</p><pre>world.log &lt;&lt; "[__LINE__]: myvar = [myvar]"
</pre>
<p>
Sometimes debugging output such as this is simply removed after fixing the
problem, but sometimes you may want diagnostic information to appear
whenever you are testing the code.  In this case, a macro such as the
following may be useful.
</p><p>

</p><pre>#ifdef DEBUG
#define debug world.log
#else
#define debug null
#endif
</pre>
<p>
You can then send output to <code>debug</code> and it will be ignored when not in
<var>DEBUG</var> mode.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Another tool for hunting bugs is to comment out code.  This may be helpful
when determining whether a certain piece of code is responsible for an
observed problem.  By simplifying the procedure and gradually disabling all
but the code which causes the glitch, you can save yourself from
scrutinizing a lot of irrelevant material.
</p><p>
This is also essential when asking others for help.  Nobody wants to read
through pages and pages of somebody else's code.  If you can't see the
problem yourself but can isolate it down to a small piece of code, you will
find it much easier (and fruitful) when getting help from other programmers.
Sometimes just trying to clearly define the problem enables you to suddenly
see the solution yourself--avoiding the embarrassment altogether.
