  dreamer, with a slow or sudden rush of understanding like a wash of cool
  water, knows himself to have been merely asleep and dreaming, to have
  merely invented the pointless task; the dreamer awakes relieved in his own
  bed and rises yawning, and has odd adventures, which go on until (with a
  slow sudden rush of understanding) he awakes in this palace antechamber;

Savefiles are used to store information on the disk.  There are two reasons
why this is usually done.  One is to store information about the world so
that it can be shut down and rebooted (possibly with new code).  The saved
information can then be loaded and the relevant aspects of the world
restored to their previous state.
</p><p>
Another reason for using savefiles is to store information about players.
Such player savefiles may be used to re-create their mobs when they log in
or could even be transferred from one world to another along with the
player.  In this way, a world could be distributed across several servers
running in parallel.

<h3><a name="12.1">1. The <var>savefile</var> Object</a></h3>
<a name="12.1">

<p>
The <var>savefile</var> data object provides control over a savefile on the
disk.  It is another built-in object type in DM.  All data that is read from
or written to the file goes through the <var>savefile</var> object.
</p><p>
To create a <var>savefile</var> object, the <var>new</var> instruction is used.

<p></p><p>
If a file with the specified name already exists, it will be used by the
<var>savefile</var>.  Otherwise, a new one is created.  If no name is
specified, a unique temporary file will be created.
</p><p>
When the <var>savefile</var> object is deleted the specified file will
remain.  It can be accessed at a later time by creating another
<var>savefile</var> object with the same name.  Notice the difference between
creating the object and creating the file.  Several savefile objects may be
created to access the same physical file.  That file is only created once
and lasts until it is explicitly removed.
</p></a><p><a name="12.1">
The only case in which this is not true is when no name was given and a
temporary file was used.  In that case, the file is deleted along with the
<var>savefile</var> object.  Such temporary savefiles may be useful when
loading information from another world, as will be described in section
</a><a href="#World2World">12.6</a>.

<h3><a name="12.2">2. Saving Players</a></h3>
<a name="12.2">
<p>
The first case we shall consider is how to save a player when they log out
and restore them when they log back in.  By doing that, you are free to
delete their mob when they aren't around; it is just taking up memory and
probably getting into mischief--best to put the avatar into suspended
animation until the player returns.  Another practical reason is that you
can freely reboot (or horror of horrors) crash the world without losing
player information.  <small>(And if you make a backup of the savefile, you
are "free" to crash your hard-drive too.  What fun!)</small>  
</p><p>
The mob <var>Write</var> proc is used to store information about a player and
the <var>Read</var> proc is used to restore it.  These both take a savefile as
an argument.

<p></p><p>
By default, the <var>Write</var> procedure stores the value of each object
variable.  You will see later how to add additional information or how to
control which variables are saved.
</p><p>
For now, let's just use the default <var>Read</var> and <var>Write</var> procs
to save a player.  It can be done like this:
</p><p>

</p><pre>mob/Logout()
   var/savefile/F = new(ckey)
   Write(F)
   del(src)

mob/Login()
   var/savefile/F = new(ckey)
   Read(F)
   return ..()
</pre>
<p>
In this case, each player is saved in a separate file with the same name as
their key.  To make sure it is a valid file name, we used ckey, the
canonical form of the key, which is stripped of punctuation.  This is still
guaranteed to be unique, so there is no fear of conflict.
</p><p>
You might be wondering what happens when a new player logs in.  Since they
don't have a savefile, a new one will be created.  The <var>Read</var> proc,
of course, will find this file to be empty and will therefore return without
making any changes.
</p><p>
When an existing player logs in, on the other hand, each variable will be
restored to the value it had when last saved.  Some of those variables may
just be numbers or text.  Some, like the contents list, may be more
complicated.  Those are handled too.  <small>(Gasp.  Or at least inhale
with slight exaggeration.  Otherwise, you won't fully appreciate the
sentence you just read.)</small>  
</p></a><p><a name="12.2">
</a><a name="12.2.1">
</a></p>
<h4><a name="12.2.1">2.1 tmp Variables</a></h4>
<a name="12.2.1">

<p>
A few things are not saved.  For example, the mob's location is not
restored.  That is because the location is a reference to an external object
(like a turf).  If that value were written to the savefile, it would be
treated just like an item in the contents list--the whole object would be
written to the savefile.  That is certainly not what you want in the case of
the mob's location.
</p><p>
Variables like <var>loc</var> are called temporary or transient variables,
because their value is computed at run-time (when the mob is added to the
contents list of a turf).  In some cases, temporary variables would just be
wasting space in the savefile, but in others (like <var>loc</var>), it would
be incorrect to save and restore them as though they were objects "belonging"
to the player.
</p><p>
The <var>Write</var> proc already knows about the built-in temporary
variables.  If you define any of your own, however, you need to mark them as
such.  You do that with the <var>tmp</var> variable type modifier.  The syntax
is just like <var>global</var> and <var>const</var>.
</p><p>
The following example defines some temporary variables that reference
external objects.  We don't happen to want those objects (in this case other
mobs) to be saved along with the player.  Since there is no way for the
compiler to know that, we have to tell it by using the <var>tmp</var> flag.
</p><p>

</p><pre>mob
   var/tmp
      mob/leader
      followers[]

<h4><a name="12.2.2">2.2 Overriding <var>Write</var> and <var>Read</var></a></h4>
<a name="12.2.2">
<p>
In some cases, you might want to restore temporary variables when the player
is loaded.  Take the case of the player's location.  You may not want it
saved as an object but rather as a coordinate that can be restored when the
player returns.
</p><p>
In other words, you want to save it by <em>reference</em> rather than by
<em>value</em>.  The trick is, you have to find some sort of reference that
will still be valid in the future--possibly even after you have recompiled
and rebooted the world.  That is why the compiler leaves this sort of thing
up to you: only you can decide how best to do it.
</p><p>
In this case, we will simply save the player's map coordinates.  The
following example gets the job done, but you will see an even better way to
do it later.
</p><p>

</p><pre>mob
   var
      saved_x
      saved_y
      saved_z

   Write(savefile/F)
      saved_x = x
      saved_y = y
      saved_z = z
      ..() //store variables
   Read(savefile/F)
      ..() //restore variables
      Move(locate(saved_x,saved_y,saved_z))
</pre>
<p>
All we did was copy the player's coordinates into non-temporary variables
before calling the default <var>Write</var> proc.  Then, when loading the
player, we simply moved back to the same spot.
</p><p>
You are probably thinking it would be more efficient if you could just write
the coordinates to the file yourself rather than making dummy variables for
the purpose.  You are right.  Working directly with savefiles is next.
</p></a><p><a name="12.2.2">
</a><a name="12.3">
</a></p>
<h3><a name="12.3">3. The Structure of a Save File</a></h3>
<a name="12.3">

<p>
The interior of a savefile is structured like a tree.  Each node in the tree
has a data buffer and may also contain additional sub-nodes.  (A
<em>buffer</em> is simply a sequence of stored values.)  Since the file-system
is such a familiar analogy, we shall call the nodes <em>directories</em> and
the top node in the savefile shall be called the <em>root</em>
directory.  <small>(Yes, savefiles are upside-down trees just like the DM
object tree.)</small>  
</p><p>
Do not be confused between savefile directories and file-system
directories.  The savefile itself is just a single file.  The
<var>savefile</var> object simply presents the contents of that file in the
form of a hierarchical directory structure.  To distinguish between the two,
one calls these <em>data</em> directories as opposed to <em>file</em>
directories.
</p><p>
The purpose of all this is to allow you to organize information in a logical
format.  For example, you could have a master savefile with a directory for
each player.  Or different aspects of the world could be stored in different
directories.  The freedom to organize things in such a manner is not merely
esthetic; it determines what data can be saved and retrieved as a unit.  If
everything were simply written in one continuous stream of data, the entire
file would have to be read from the beginning in order to find, say, the
information about a particular player.
</p></a><p><a name="12.3">
</a><a name="12.3.1">
</a></p>
<h4><a name="12.3.1">3.1 <var>cd</var> variable</a></h4>
<a name="12.3.1">

<p>
The savefile variable <var>cd</var> contains the path of the current data
directory within the savefile.  These paths are like DM object type paths
except they are stored in a text string.  The root is a slash <code>"/"</code>,
which also serves as the delimiter between directory names like this:
<code>"/dir1/dir2"</code>.
</p><p>
By assigning <var>cd</var>, the current directory can be changed.  An absolute
path may be specified (beginning with the root <code>"/"</code>) or a path
relative to the current directory may be used.  The special path name
<code>".."</code> may be used to represent the parent of the current directory.
No matter how you assign it, the new value of <var>cd</var> will always be the
resulting absolute path.
</p><p>
It is possible to change to a directory that does not exist.  If data is
written to it, the new directory will be automatically created in the
savefile.  Valid directory names are the same as node names in DM code;
letters, digits, and the underscore may be used to any length.  They are case
sensitive, so "KingDan" is different from "kingdan".

<h4><a name="12.3.2">3.2 <var>dir</var> variable</a></h4>
<a name="12.3.2">

<p>
The <var>dir</var> savefile variable is a list of directory names inside the
current directory.  An entire directory can be deleted by removing it from
this list.  It is also commonly used to test for the existence of a
directory.
</p><p>
In the following example, a check is made when players log in to see if they
already exist in a master savefile.
</p><p>

</p><pre>var/savefile/SaveFile = new("players.sav")

mob/Login()
   SaveFile.cd = "/"  //make sure we are at the root

      Read(SaveFile)
      usr &lt;&lt; "Welcome back, [name]!"
   else
      usr &lt;&lt; "Welcome, [name]!"

each player.

<h3><a name="12.4">4. Data Buffers</a></h3>
<a name="12.4">
</a><a name="ReadWrite">
<p>
Information in a savefile is stored in buffers.  These are sequential
records of one or more values.  The term <em>sequential</em> or <em>serial</em>
implies that values which are written in a particular order must be read
back in that same order.  This is different from <em>random access</em> data
which may be retrieved in any order (like items in a DM list object).  In a
savefile, the directories are randomly accessed and the data within buffers
is sequentially accessed.  The two methods each serve their own purpose.

<p></p><p>
When a directory is not specified, the current position in the buffer is
accessed.  This position always starts at the beginning when the directory
is entered (by setting <var>cd</var>).  Subsequent values are appended to the
buffer as they are written.
</p><p>
When a directory is specified, the value written replaces any previous
contents of the given directory.  This is equivalent to entering the
directory, writing to it, returning to the previous directory, and restoring
the position in the buffer.  An absolute or relative path may be used to
specify the location of the directory.
</p><p>
We can now return to the problem of saving the player's coordinates.  Before,
this had to be done using dummy variables.  Now it can be done directly.
</p><p>

</p><pre>mob/Write(savefile/F)
   //store coordinates
   F &lt;&lt; x
   F &lt;&lt; y
   F &lt;&lt; z
   //store variables
   ..()
mob/Read(savefile/F)
   var {saved_x; saved_y; saved_z}
   //load coordinates
   F &gt;&gt; saved_x
   F &gt;&gt; saved_y
   F &gt;&gt; saved_z
   //restore variables
   ..()
   //restore coordinates
   Move(locate(saved_x,saved_y,saved_z))
</pre>
<p>
Ok, so we still had to define some dummy variables, but at least they are
hidden in the <var>Read</var> proc rather than cluttering up the object
definition.  That saves memory and, as it happens, it also saves space in
the savefile, because we chose to write the coordinates sequentially into
the same buffer rather than into three separately named buffers.

</a></p>
<h4><a name="12.4.2">4.2 Stored Variables</a></h4>
<a name="12.4.2">
<p>
The way variables are normally stored is to make a separate directory for
each one with the same name as the variable.  If you wanted complete control
over the savefile format, you could do that yourself with something like the
following code:
</p><p>

</p><pre>mob/Write(savefile/F)
   F["name"]   &lt;&lt; name
   F["gender"] &lt;&lt; gender
   F["icon"]   &lt;&lt; icon
mob/Read(savefile/F)
   F["name"]   &gt;&gt; name
   F["gender"] &gt;&gt; gender
   F["icon"]   &gt;&gt; icon
</pre>
<p>
The advantage of having each variable in its own directory is flexibility.
In the future, you could add or remove variables and old savefiles would
still work.  That saves you the headache of trying to maintain backwards
compatibility in a single sequential buffer as items come and go.
</p><p>
On the other hand, values which will always be grouped together can be more
efficiently saved in a single buffer.  That is how we handled the three map
coordinates in the previous example.  There is less overhead, the fewer
times you have to change directories.

<h4><a name="12.4.3">4.3 Data Directories</a></h4>
<a name="12.4.3">
<p>
The notation introduced above for reading and writing to a specified
directory works in general--not just on the left-hand side of the
input/output operators <b>&lt;&lt;</b> and
<b>&gt;&gt;</b>.  The syntax is a savefile followed by a
directory path in square brackets.  This accesses the first value in the
specified buffer and may be used in any expression, including assignments.
It therefore behaves like a sort of permanent variable, which is a
convenient device.
</p></a><p><a name="12.4.3">
</a><a name="12.4.4">
</a></p>
<h4><a name="12.4.4">4.4 Saving Objects</a></h4>
<a name="12.4.4">
<p>
You may be wondering why we didn't use the <b>&lt;&lt;</b>
operator to write players to a savefile.  Instead we have been calling the
<var>Write</var> proc.  With minor modifications, we could have used
<b>&lt;&lt;</b>.  In fact, <b>&lt;&lt;</b> internally
calls <var>Write</var> when saving an object, so it would almost be the same.
</p><p>
The difference between directly calling <var>Write</var> verses using
<b>&lt;&lt;</b> to save an object is in how the object will be
recreated.  When <b>&gt;&gt;</b> is used, a <em>new</em>
object is returned.  Obviously when you call the object's <var>Read</var> proc
directly, the object must already exist.
</p><p>
The <b>&lt;&lt;</b> operator works by first recording the type of
the object being saved.  It then moves into a fresh temporary directory and
calls the object's <var>Write</var> proc.  When this returns, the entire
contents of the temporary directory (sub-directories and all) are packed up
and written as a single value after the object type information which was
already saved.  This allows you to treat an object like any other value when
it is written to a serial buffer.  <small>(Programmers refer to this
process as serialization of the object.)</small>  
</p><p>
The <b>&gt;&gt;</b> operator simply reverses the sequence of
operations.  It reads the stored type, creates a new object, and calls its
<var>Read</var> proc.
</p><p>
The terminology used to distinguish between the two different cases is a
<em>property</em> save verses an <em>instance</em> save.  When you call
<var>Write</var> directly, you are doing a property save, because you are only
saving the properties of the object.  When you instead use
<b>&lt;&lt;</b>, you are doing an instance save, because you are
saving a full instance of the object (along with its properties).  You must
use the same method for restoring an object that you used to save it.

<h5><a name="12.4.4.1">4.4.1 Saving a Player Instance</a></h5>
<a name="12.4.4.1">
<p>
Up until now, we assumed that the mob created for a player logging in was
the same type as the mob which was last saved.  If your world allows players
to inhabit other types of mobs, however, this assumption could be wrong.  In
that case, you would want to create a new mob from the savefile rather than
using the default <var>world.mob</var>.  In other words, you would want to save
the mob instance rather than just saving its properties.
</p><p>

</p><pre>client/New()
   var/savefile/F = new(ckey)
   F &gt;&gt; usr
   return ..()
client/Del()
   var/savefile/F = new(ckey)
   F &lt;&lt; usr
   del(usr)
</pre>
<p>
In this case, we handled saving in <var>client.New</var> rather than
<var>mob.Login</var>.  There are two reasons.  One is that we want to create
the mob from the savefile before the default <var>client.New</var> creates one
for us.  The second reason is that presumably this world allows the player to
switch from one mob to another.  If that is the case, we can't use
<var>Login</var> as an indicator that the player is signing into the game; it
might just be a movement from one mob to another.
</p><p>
In all the examples up to this point, we have been using server-side
savefiles.  That just means they are stored on the server's filesystem.  It
is also possible to store savefiles on the player's computer.  These are
called client-side savefiles.

<h3><a name="12.5">5. The Key Save File</a></h3>
<a name="12.5">

<p>
The player's key may have a savefile attached to it.  This file can be
obtained by calling <var>client.Import()</var>.  It returns a savefile
reference or <var>null</var> if there is none.
</p><p>
To copy a savefile back to the key, <var>client.Export()</var> is used.
Note that if changes are made to an imported file, these are not saved to
the key unless that file is exported.  That is because behind the scenes,
<var>Import</var> and <var>Export</var> upload and download the savefile from
the client to the server.  The imported file on the server side is merely a
temporary copy of the key's savefile.

<p></p><p>
If no file is specified in the call to <var>Export()</var>, the key's savefile
is deleted.  If a value other than a savefile is given, this is written into
a temporary savefile and exported to the key.  Similarly, an object may be
passed to <var>Import()</var> and it will be automatically read from the file.

<h4><a name="12.5.1">5.1 Client-Side Saving</a></h4>
<a name="12.5.1">

One reason to use client-side saving is if the player will be connecting to a
group of worlds which all share the same savefile format.  That way, changes
made to the player's mob in one world would be automatically transferred to
any of the other worlds the player accesses.

<p>
Like the previous server-side example, the player is loaded in
<var>Login()</var>.  However, it is not a good idea to save the player in
<var>Logout()</var> as we did before, because in this case the client is needed
in order to export the file.  By the time <var>Logout()</var> is called, the
player may have already disconnected.
</p><p>
It is therefore necessary to save the player before logging out.  The
<var>SavePlayer()</var> proc in this example was defined for that purpose, but
it needs to be called from somewhere else in the code.  You could do that
every time a change is made or whenever the player requests it.  Another
method is to require the player to exit properly from the world in order to
be saved rather than simply disconnecting without warning.

<h3><a name="12.6">6. Transmission Between Worlds</a></h3>
<a name="12.6">
</a><a name="World2World">
<p>
Client-side savefiles are one method for transferring player information
between worlds.  This is best used when the player is free to randomly
connect to any one of the worlds.  It is also suited for situations in which
the contents of the player savefile are not sensitive--that is, the player
can't cheat by modifying or backing up the file.
</p><p>
There are times when a client-side savefile is not appropriate.  In that
case, savefiles can be transferred directly between worlds without using the
player's key as an intermediary.  That gives you assured control over the
contents of the file.

<a name="12.6.1">

</a><p><a name="12.6.1">
The procedures for transferring files between worlds are similar to the ones
for manipulating the player's key file.  The procedure
<var>world.Export()</var> can be used to send a file.  This causes a message
to be sent to the remote world, which handles it in the
<var>world.Topic()</var> procedure.  If the remote world expects and is
willing to receive a savefile, it calls <var>world.Import()</var> to download
it.  These three procedures were already introduced in section
</a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap08.html#WorldTopicProc">8.2.4</a>.
</p>
<p>
There are a few differences between the world <var>Import</var> and
<var>Export</var> procs and the corresponding client procs.  In the case of
exporting from one world to another, the remote world's network address and
import topic must be specified in addition to the file being sent.
</p>
<p>
On the remote end, <var>world.Import()</var> is used to receive the file, just
as with a key file.  However, this results in the savefile being
downloaded into the world's resource cache.  A reference to this cache file
is returned instead of automatically creating a <var>savefile</var> object as
<var>client.Import()</var> does.  That allows for the transferral of other
types of files.  The cache reference can be easily opened as a temporary
savefile by simply specifying it in place of the name of the file to open.

<h4><a name="12.6.2">6.2 A Sample Player Transferal System</a></h4>
<a name="12.6.2">
<p>
The following code demonstrates how player savefiles can be transferred
directly from one world to another.  The destination world is imagined here
to be running at the address <tt>dm.edu</tt> on port 2001.  This address
could be any other hard-coded value, or even a variable set at run-time.
</p><p>

</p><pre>mob/proc/GotoMars()
   var/savefile/F = new()
   F &lt;&lt; src
   if(!world.Export("dm.edu:2001#player",F))
      usr &lt;&lt; "Mars is not correctly aligned at the moment."
      return
   usr &lt;&lt; link("dm.edu:2001")

world/Topic(T)
   if(T == "player")
      //download and open savefile
      var/savefile/F = new(Import())

      //load mob
      var/mob/M
      F &gt;&gt; M

      return 1
</pre>
<p>
The <code>GotoMars()</code> proc sends a player to the remote world.  It simply
writes the player to a file and then sends it.  In this example we happen to
be using a full object save on the mob rather than a mere property save, but
it could be done another way.  Note how the return value of <var>Export()</var>
is checked to ensure that the remote world is alive and well before sending
the player along.
</p><p>
The code for <var>world.Topic()</var> actually belongs in the code for the
remote world, but here we assume that both worlds have the same player
import facilities.  The "player" topic causes a savefile to be imported and
read.  The mob which is created as a result is ready and waiting when the
player connects to the new world.  One could instead store the savefile and
load it when the player arrives.

<p>
You may not want just anyone sending savefiles to your worlds.  There are a
couple strategies to limit access.  One is to keep the import topic a
secret.  Another would be to put a password in the savefile itself.
</p><p>
Access can also be limited to specific network addresses.  The address of
the sending world is passed as an argument to <var>world.Topic</var>.  This
could be compared to a list of permitted addresses and permission granted
accordingly.
</p><p>
To get such a system working, it might be useful to use something like the
following code to test the sending and receiving of messages.  It simply
allows you to specify the address and topic you wish to send and displays
the result.
</p><p>

</p><pre>mob/verb/export(Addr as text)
   usr &lt;&lt; "Export([Addr]) == \..."
   usr &lt;&lt; world.Export(Addr)

world/Topic(T,Addr)
   world.log &lt;&lt; "Topic([T]) from address [Addr]."
   return 1

<h4><a name="12.6.4">6.4 Sharing Object Types</a></h4>
<a name="12.6.4">
<p>
Care must be taken when transferring objects from one world to another that
the same type of object is defined in both places.  If an object type that
was saved in a file does not exist when it is loaded, it cannot be created
and <var>null</var> will be returned instead.
</p></a><p><a name="12.6.4">
The most fool-proof strategy is to compile every world with the same code
base in which all the transferable object types are defined.  Techniques for
splitting the code in large projects into multiple files is a topic that
will be discussed in chapter </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap19.html#BigProjectChapter">19</a> and is a useful method
of re-using code for this purpose.

</a><a name="AdvancedSavefiles">

<p>
Most of the time, the default reading and writing behavior works and you
don't have to think too hard about <em>how</em> it works.  I am going to tell
you how it works anyway.  If you don't want to know, please shut your eyes
while reading this section.
</p><p>
Those of you who still have your eyes open get to learn about a few powerful
elements of the language.  You will probably never use them, but powerful
knowledge should rarely be used anyway.  <small>(Knowing how to build an
H-bomb is a good example.)</small>    It just helps put everything else in perspective.
</p><p>
I will start by showing you how you could soft-code the default save
routines.  Then I will explain how it works.  Then I will explain how it
really works.  Then the rest of you can open your eyes again.
</p><p>

</p><pre>mob/Write(savefile/F)
   var/V
   for(V in vars)
      if(issaved(vars[V]))
         if(initial(vars[V]) == vars[V])
            F.dir.Remove(V)    //just in case
         else F[V] &lt;&lt; vars[V]  //write variable
mob/Read(savefile/F)
   var/V
   for(V in vars)
      if(issaved(vars[V]))
         if(V in F.dir)
            F[V] &gt;&gt; vars[V]    //read variable
</pre>
<p>
This same code would, of course, be defined for object types other than mob
as well.  It depends only on the existence of a special variable named
<var>vars</var>, which happens to be defined for all object types.  It is a
list of the variables belonging to an object.
</p><p>
You can access and loop through <var>vars</var> like any other list.  The only
special behavior is that when you index it with the name of a variable, you
get, not the name, but the value of the variable.  So whenever you see
<code>vars[V]</code> in the above code, it is accessing the value of the mob's
variable whose name is stored in <code>V</code>.  Note that this value can even
be modified.  It is just as if you were accessing the variable directly.
</p><p>
The next thing you must be wondering about in the above code is
<var>issaved()</var>.  That is where we check to see if the variable being
considered is temporary.  If the variable is marked global, const, or tmp,
it is not saved to the file because the <var>issaved</var> instruction returns
0.
</p><p>
Finally, before saving the variable, we check if it has changed.  We do that
by using the <var>initial()</var> instruction to get the original compile-time
value of the variable.  Only if the variable has changed is it saved.  That
saves space, but it also makes the savefile more adaptable.  In the future,
you may wish to change the default value of a variable.  When you recompile
your world, existing savefiles will automatically use the new value if the
variable still had its initial value when saved.

<h4><a name="12.7.1">7.1 Duplicate References</a></h4>
<a name="12.7.1">
<p>
If you think for a while (maybe a long while) about the above saving scheme,
you will come to the conclusion that it is subtly flawed.  Fortunately, the
savefile is smarter than you think.
</p><p>
Each variable is written to its own directory using the
<b>&lt;&lt;</b> operator, be it a number, text string, object, or
list of objects.  That means, of course, that objects are written in full.
If we are saving a player who has a bunch of items in the contents list, an
instance of each of these is written to the file.
</p><p>
But what happens if two variables refer to the same object?  If these were
each written as a separate instance, the savefile would contain two
independent instances of the same object.  When loading this information, a
new object would be created for each reference to the original one.  That
could lead to all sorts of subtle problems.  Ick.
</p><p>
Fortunately, the savefile can detect this case and handle it correctly.
During any single savefile operation, such as writing an object, a special
de-duplication mode is entered.  In this mode, the first occurrence of an
object is written in full but subsequent occurrences are written as a
reference to the first one.  This will even handle recursive references that
would otherwise cause an infinite loop.
</p><p>
De-duplication mode lasts for the duration of the first operation that
initiated it.  For example, if you write a mob to the savefile,
de-duplication mode will extend through the writing of each mob variable,
which might in turn include writing entire objects belonging to the mob.
All duplicate references within the single top-most operation will be
detected.
</p><p>
The only rule you must abide by is to make sure things are always read back
in the same order they were written.  That ensures that the first occurrence
of an object (which is saved in full) will be restored before any references
to it are encountered.
