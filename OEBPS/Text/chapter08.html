 <h2 align="center">The <var>world</var> Data Object</h2>



<p>
</p>
<blockquote>  Is it a dream?<br/>

  Nay but the lack of it the dream,<br/>

  And failing it life's lore and wealth a dream,<br/>

  And all the world a dream.<br/>

</blockquote>
<center>--<i>Walt Whitman</i>, Song of the Universal</center>

<p>
The object types you have seen so far are mob, obj, turf, and area.  These
are the atomic objects seen and manipulated by players.  There are other
types of data objects which only you, the programmer, can manipulate.  To
distinguish between the two, we either use the term <em>atom</em> or
<em>datum</em>.  The atoms are the physical building blocks for the world and
the datums are intangible creatures consisting purely of data.
</p>
<p>
  <small>(Yes, I know the plural of datum is data.  But that doesn't
rhyme with atoms.  In programming, poetic concerns outweigh linguistic
trifles.  However, I may occasionally slip and refer to them as <em>data
objects</em>.)</small>  
</p>
<p>
DM provides datums for world and player information, lists, and save files.
You can also define your own data objects to manage information in whatever
manner you like.  These topics will all be discussed in the following
chapters.
</p>
<p>
The <var>world</var> object is created when the server starts and destroyed
when it finishes.  The global variable <var>world</var> contains a reference to
this object.  The variables and procedures belonging to this object are
defined under <tt>/world</tt>.  By changing these, you can modify the
behavior of the game as a whole.
</p>

<h3><a name="8.1">1. <var>world</var> variables</a></h3>
<a name="8.1">
</a><a name="WorldVars">
<p>
The variables of the <var>world</var> data object are described in the
following list.
</p><p>

</p><p>
</p><li><b>name</b>

<p>
is the name of the world.  By default it is the same name as the <tt>dmb</tt>
file without the extension.  Players will see this as the name of the world
they are connected to.
</p><p>
</p></li><li><b>mob</b>

<p>
is the type of mob created for new players when they log in.  By
default it is <code>/mob</code>.
</p><p>
</p></li><li><b>turf</b>

<p>
is the default turf to be placed on the map when none other is
specified.  By default it is <code>/turf</code>.
</p><p>
</p></li><li><b>area</b>

<p>
is the default area placed on the map when none other is specified.  By
default it is <code>/area</code>.
</p><p>
</p></li><li><b>maxx,maxy,maxz</b>

<p>
are the size of the map.  Normally, you would not set this in the code but
would let the map file produced by the map editor do the job.  However, if
you only want a map with the default turf and area, you can create it by
specifying the size here.  These variables all default to 0 (no map at all)
but if you set any one of them, the others will default to 1.  So, for
example, you can set <var>maxx</var> and <var>maxy</var> without bothering to set
<var>maxz</var> to get a one-level map.
</p><p>
</p></li></a><li><a name="WorldVars"><b>view</b>

</a><p><a name="WorldVars">
is the maximum view range.  The default value of 5 gives you an 11x11 map
viewport.  The maximum value of 10 yields a 21x21 map.  More will be said
about this in chapter </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap14.html#MapChapter">14</a>.
</p><p>
</p></li>
<li><b>contents</b>

<p>
is a list of all the real objects in the world (that is mobs, objs, turfs,
and areas).  When the <var>world</var> is used where a list is expected, this
list will be used.
</p><p>
</p></li>
<li><b>log</b>

<p>
is a useful destination for debugging output.  Text sent here is
displayed by the server program in its output.  When running a world
directly inside the client (the local server), the text is displayed on the
client terminal.  Internal errors, like proc crashes, are all reported to
<var>world.log</var>.
</p><p>
</p></li>
<li><b>params</b>

<a name="WorldParams">
</a><p><a name="WorldParams">
is a list of user-defined parameters supplied to the world before it was
started.  More will be said about this in section </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap10.html#ParameterLists">10.9</a>.
</p><p>
</p></li>
<li><b>realtime</b>

<p>
is the time in 10$^ths$ of seconds since 00:00:00 GMT, January 1,
2000 (also known as BYOND time).  The principal use for this is when you
need to record when something happened (like when a user last logged in).
</p><p>
</p></li>
<li><b>time</b>

<p>
is the length in 10$^ths$ of seconds that the world has been running
(also known as game time).  This is actually a measure of cpu time rather
than real time.  For example, if the server sleeps when no players are logged
in, that time is not counted.
</p><p>
</p></li>
<li><b>sleep_offline</b>

<p>
if set to 1 will cause the world to be suspended when there are no players.
The default value is 0, which means the world will only be suspended if
nothing is going on.  Use this variable if you don't want your NPCs to get
up to mischief while the humans are away.
</p><p>
</p></li>
<li><b>tick_lag</b>

<p>
controls the length of time between one moment and the next.  It is the
smallest meaningful unit of time (measured in 10$^ths$ of seconds).  The
default value is 1, which means all events in the world happen in increments
of 0.1 seconds.  The smaller this value, the more precise timings will be,
the faster players can issue commands, etc.  The cost of this, however, is
in extra load on the cpu.  If it gets too high, the extra overhead can
actually make the game run slower as a result.  More will be said on the
subject of event timing in chapter <a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap13.html#RealtimeChapter">13</a>.
</p><p>
</p></li>
<li><b>cpu</b>

<p>
is the percentage of time being used up by the server in running the
world.  It is normally close to 0, indicating that the server is getting
everything done ahead of schedule and then twiddling its thumbs for the rest
of the tick.  A value over 100 would indicate that the server is not able to
get everything done in the allocated amount of time (i.e. <var>tick_lag</var>).
Usually, you don't need the <var>cpu</var> variable to tell you when this is
happening.  When the game becomes sluggish (and its not a matter of network
traffic) it probably means the cpu is overloaded.
</p><p>
</p></li>
<li><b>address</b>

<p>
is the network address of the machine hosting the world or <var>null</var> if
this cannot be determined.
</p><p>
</p></li>
<li><b>port</b>

<p>
is the port number of the world or 0 if the world has no open network port.
The full address of the world is formed by combining the world address and
port like this: <code>"[address]:[port]"</code>.
</p><p>


</p><p>
<a name="8.2">
</a></p><h3><a name="8.2">2. <var>world</var> procs</a></h3><a name="8.2">
</a><a name="WorldProcs">
<p>
The various <var>world</var> procs provide control over the server and allow
you to respond to events which affect it.  They are described in the
following sections.
</p></a><p><a name="WorldProcs">
</a><a name="8.2.1">
</a></p><h4><a name="8.2.1">2.1 <var>New</var> and <var>Del</var></a></h4><a name="8.2.1">

<p>
Like all data objects, <var>world</var> has <var>New</var> and <var>Del</var>
procs, which are called at creation and destruction of the world.  They do
not take any arguments.  The only thing to happen before <var>New</var> gets
called is initialization of global variables and creation of the map and its
contents.  Similarly, <var>Del</var> is called prior to destroying the map and
other existing objects.
</p></a><p><a name="8.2.1">
You could use these procs to perform any initialization while loading and
cleanup when shutting down.  One common task would be to read and write
information about the state of the world to a save file, which will be
covered in chapter </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap12.html#SavefileChapter">12</a>.
</p><p>

</p><pre>world
   New()
      world.log &lt;&lt; "[name] started at [realtime]."
      ..()
   Del()
      world.log &lt;&lt; "[name] shutdown at [realtime]."
      ..()
</pre>
<p>
In this example output is sent to <var>world.log</var>.  Since it may be true
that no players are connected at the time, that is a useful destination for
output in procs of this nature.
</p><p>
<a name="8.2.2">
</a></p><h4><a name="8.2.2">2.2 <var>Repop</var> proc</a></h4><a name="8.2.2">

<p>
The <var>Repop</var> proc <em>re-populates</em> the map.  Any objects (that is
mobs or objs) which have been destroyed and which were on the initial map
will be recreated in their original positions.
</p><p>
This simple example gives the DM mob a command to restore the world's
depleted population.
</p><p>

</p><pre>mob/DM
   verb/repop()
      world.Repop()
</pre>
<p>
Any objects which one does not want re-populated could be created dynamically
(that is using <var>new</var>) instead of with the map editor.  Otherwise, one
could just avoid deleting them by moving them to the null location instead.
Only deleted objects created with the map editor will be restored by
<var>Repop</var>.
</p></a><p><a name="8.2.2">
In many cases, you might want to automatically call <var>Repop</var> every so
often.  That will be covered later in chapter </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap13.html#RealtimeChapter">13</a> on
scheduling events.
</p><p>
<a name="8.2.3">
</a></p><h4><a name="8.2.3">2.3 <var>Reboot</var> proc</a></h4><a name="8.2.3">

<p>
The <var>Reboot</var> proc causes the entire world to be recreated from
scratch.  Any players who are connected will automatically re-login once the
world has finished loading.
</p><p>
This could be used to restart the server when you have recompiled the dmb
file with revised code.  In that case, a simple command could give the DM
power to cause the reboot.
</p><p>

</p><pre>mob/DM
   verb/reboot()
      world.Reboot()
</pre>
<p>
If you need to save any information about the state of the world, you could
do so by overriding the <var>Reboot</var> proc.  This would first save the
information and then call the parent proc to perform the reboot.
</p></a><p><a name="8.2.3">
</a><a name="8.2.4">
</a></p><h4><a name="8.2.4">2.4 Inter-world Communication</a></h4><a name="8.2.4">
</a><a name="WorldTopicProc">
</a><p><a name="WorldTopicProc">
It is possible for two worlds running on the network to communicate with
each other.  This opens up some very interesting possibilities, including
mega-worlds distributed across the network, taking advantage of the
parallelism of multiple machines.  It is a large topic, worthy of its own
chapter, and it shall have one.  However, this section briefly introduces
the procs which make it possible, just to give you a complete introduction
to the <var>world</var> data object.  For the conclusion of this story, see
section </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap12.html#World2World">12.6</a>.

<a name="8.2.4.1">
</a></p><h5><a name="8.2.4.1">2.4.1 <var>Topic</var> proc</a></h5><a name="8.2.4.1">

<p>
The <var>Topic</var> proc receives messages from other worlds.  When worlds
communicate, they must pick a topic of conversation--hence the name of the
proc.  Often the topic itself is the entire message, but you will see in a
following section how to send more data.
</p><p>
</p><table align="center" border="1"><tbody><tr><td>
<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><td>
<var>Topic</var> </td>
<td> (Topic,Addr,Master) </td>

<tr><td>
               </td>
<td> <code>Topic</code> is the topic text string. </td>

<tr><td>
               </td>
<td> <code>Addr</code> is the address of the remote world. </td>

               </td>

</tbody>

<p></p><p>
The return value of the <var>Topic</var> proc gets sent back to the remote
world.  It is therefore possible to ask simple questions, by sending a
message and getting back a response.
</p><p>

</p><p>
The most basic question is, "are you there?"  This example shows how you
might handle it.
</p><p>

</p><pre>world/Topic(Topic)
   if(Topic == "ping") return 1
   ..()
</pre>
<p>
Actually, the "ping" topic is such a common one that it is built in to the
default <var>Topic</var> proc.  The only difference is that it returns one
plus the number of players, a useful piece of information which is always
true.  The reason we want to return a true value is that the remote world
will get <var>null</var> back if it tries to send a message to a non-existent
address.
</p></a><p><a name="8.2.4.1">
</a><a name="8.2.4.2">
</a></p><h5><a name="8.2.4.2">2.4.2 <var>Export</var> proc</a></h5><a name="8.2.4.2">

<p>
The <var>Export</var> proc is used to send (or <em>export</em>) a message to
another world.  It may be used to send a file, but may also just access a
topic.  The proc returns the value passed back by the world receiving the
message.  If the message cannot be sent, <var>null</var> is returned.
</p><p>
</p><table align="center" border="1"><tbody><tr><td>
<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><td>
<var>Export</var> </td>
<td> (Addr,File) </td>

<tr><td>
                </td>
<td> <code>Addr</code> is the address and topic. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
                </td>
<td> <code>File</code> is the file to send. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>
                </td>
<td> Returns the remote <var>Topic</var>() result.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p></p><p>
The format for the address is <code>ip:port#topic</code>.  Here is an example
that uses the "ping" topic described in the previous section.
</p><p>

</p><pre>mob/DM/verb/ping()
   var/p = world.Export("dantom.com:6000#ping")
   usr &lt;&lt; "Ping returned '[p]'."
</pre>
</a><p><a name="8.2.4.2">
</a><a name="8.2.4.3">
</a></p><h5><a name="8.2.4.3">2.4.3 <var>Import</var> proc</a></h5><a name="8.2.4.3">

<p>
The <var>Import</var> proc is used to receive a file which was sent from
another world using <var>Export</var>.  It may only be used while handling a
call to the <var>Topic</var> proc.
</p><p>
</p><table align="center" border="1"><tbody><tr><td>
<table border="0">
<tbody><tr><td>
<var>Import</var> </td>
<td> () </td>

<tr><td>
                </td>
<td> Returns the downloaded file.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p></p></a><p><a name="8.2.4.3">
This proc is normally used to transfer a save file and will be discussed in
greater detail in section </a><a href="../../C%3A/Users/trist/Desktop/chap12.html#World2World">12.6</a>.  However, it could be used to
send resource files too.  The following example defines a topic that
receives and plays a sound file to everyone in the world.
</p><p>

</p><pre>world/Topic(Topic)
   if(Topic == "sound")
      world &lt;&lt; Import()
</pre>
<p>
Not bad for a few lines of code!  Of course, why you would want to do this is
another question.
